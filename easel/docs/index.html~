<p> <b>Spherical Easel</b> is a program for creating diagrams in
spherical geometry that may be easily reconfigured.  In this sense, it
is similar to <a href="http://www.keypress.com/sketchpad/"> The
Geometer's Sketchpad</a> and <a
href="http://cs.unm.edu/~joel/NonEuclid/NonEuclid.html"> Non-Euclid</a>.
<b>Spherical Easel</b> is designed to be easy to use and will often
lead you through the construction of a diagram.  These notes aim to
give a complete description of the program and its features.

<p style="text-indent:0pt"> <h4> Spherical Easel's Interface</h4>

<p> When Spherical Easel is open, you will see an interface like
this:

<center>
<img src="easel.gif">
</center>

<p style="text-indent:0pt">This consists of several parts:

<ol>
<p><li style="font:plain"> a figure on which to draw.
<p><center>
<img src="figure.gif">
</center>

<p style="text-indent:0pt">
Notice that there is a message displayed in the bottom of the figure:

<center>
<img src="instructions.gif">
</center>


<p style="text-indent:0pt">
Generally speaking, Spherical Easel is at all times ready to perform
some action.  The message at the bottom of the figure usually gives
information about what action is ready to be taken and instructions as
to how to perform the action.

<li> controls for selecting the current action.

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=10>
<td valign=center>
<img src="modes.gif"> 
</td>
<td valign=center>
<img src="menus.gif">
</td></table>
</center>

<li> a taskbar for managing several different figures.
<p><center>
<img src="taskbar.gif">
</center>
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
A new figure may be created using the <b>New</b> option under the
<b>File</b> menu item.  Notice that each figure has a corresponding
button in the taskbar.  These buttons may be used to control the state
of a figure.

<p> While several independent figures may be displayed at once, only
one figure is the <em>current</em> figure to which changes may
be made.  A figure may become the current figure by either clicking on
it or clicking its corresponding button in the taskbar.
Figures may be resized, closed or iconified using the
buttons in the upper right hand corner of the window holding the
figure.  
</ol>

<a name="adding">
<h4> Adding and Moving Elements in a Figure </h4>

<p> 
<table cellpadding=10>
<td valign=top>
<p> There are four basic types of elements that can be added directly
to a figure:  points, lines, line segments and circles.  To add one of
these elements, select the appropriate button on the controls shown to
the right and follow
the instructions given.

<p> 
<table>
<td valign=top>
<img src="segments.gif"> 
</td>
<td valign=top>
Notice that points may be a part of
several elements in a figure.  For instance, in the figure to the
left, the point <b>B</b> is an endpoint of two different line
segments.  This is achieved by first defining the segment <b>AB</b>
and beginning the definition of <b>BC</b> by clicking in the point
<b>B</b>.  
</td>
</table>

<p> Individual elements in a figure may be moved by
selecting the <b>Move</b> button.  This
is perhaps the most important, and useful, feature of Spherical Easel:  
<center>
<em>
When an
element is moved, any other elements that depend on it are moved as
well. 
</em>
</center>
For instance, if we move the point <b>B</b> in the diagram, both line
segments <b>AB</b> and <b>BC</b> will move as well.

<p> Generally speaking, points are the only elements that can be
moved.  This makes a certain amount of sense:  since lines are defined
in terms of two points, we should move the points to move the line.
However, there is one exception to this rule:  when the two points are
antipodal, the line or line segment they define is not unique and it
may therefore be moved.

<p> Once some elements have been added to the figure, the sphere may
be rotated using the <b>Rotate</b> button.  Once this is selected, the
sphere may be rotated by clicking and dragging in the direction of the
desired rotation.

</td>
<td valign=top>
<img src="modes.gif">
</td>
</table>

<p> There are two features that make geometry on the sphere rather
unique. 

<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-indent:0pt"> 
You will quickly notice that the sphere has a front and a
back.  Points may be defined or moved on the back of the sphere by
pressing the <b>Ctrl</b> key while performing the necessary mouse
operations.

<li><p style="text-indent:0pt"> 
It can be difficult to draw a line segment between two
points which are nearly antipodal since the line segment is very
sensitive to small differences in the endpoints.  To help with this,
it is possible to constrain a line segment, while being defined or
moved, to lie on a given line by pressing the <b>Shift</b> key while
moving one of its endpoints.
</ol>

<a href="index.html"> Back to top </a>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="fileoperations"> <h4>File Operations</h4>

<p> Shown below are the <b>File</b> menus from the applet and
application version of Spherical Easel.

<center>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign=bottom> 
<img src="appletfilemenu.gif" hspace=10>
</td>
<td valign=bottom> 
<img src="appfilemenu.gif" hspace=10>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>
<b>Applet version</b>
</td>
<td align=center>
<b>Application version</b>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p> As you can see, the file operations avaiable when running
Spherical Easel as an applet are somewhat restricted.  In particular,
files cannot be saved, reloaded or printed.  This is due to security
restrictions placed on applets running inside web browsers.

<p> The only menu item that may need explaining is <b> Print to
PS</b>.  This will produce a version of the current figure in
PostScript and either save it to a file, in the application version,
or display it in a text window, in the applet version, from which it
may be cut and pasted into a file.  From here, the figure may easily
be included in text documents.

<p>The <b>Close</b> menu item will close the current figure.
<p style="text-indent:0pt; font:plain 10pt sans-serif, Palatino">
<a href="index.html"> Back to top </a>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="edit"> <h4>The Edit Menu</h4>

<p> <img src="editmenu.gif" align=right hspace=10> 
The Edit menu allows the appearance of a
figure to be customized.

<p> The last change made may be set aside using the <b>Undo</b> menu
item.

<p> The <b>Delete</b> menu item will delete any elements from a figure
that are subsequently selected.  When an element is deleted, any
element that depends on that element is necessarily deleted as well.

<p> When figures get rather complicated, it is often convenient to
<b>Hide</b> some of the earlier elements.  This is not the same as
<b>Delete</b>: when an element is hidden, it still exists but is just
not displayed.  Hidden elements may be redisplayed using the <b>Show
Hidden</b> menu item.

<p> Every element added to a figure is labelled.  However, these
labels are not shown by default.  To see the label of a particular
element, choose the <b>Show Label</b> menu item and select the
element.  All labels may be shown using <b>Show All Labels</b>.

<p> <img src="properties.gif" align=left hspace=10> 
Elements in a figure usually have some properties, such as the
color and label, that may be edited using the <b>Properties</b> menu
item.  When an element is selected, a dialog like that on the left is
initiated.  The dialog shown results from editing a line's
properties.  The label, whether the label is hidden,
the color of the line, its thickness and whether it is dashed may all
be modified.  

<br clear=all>

<p> <img src="contrastmenu.gif" align=right hspace=10> 
Finally, you will notice that elements on the back of the sphere
are drawn in a slightly lighter color to indicate that they are on the
back.  Depending on your monitor and the conditions under which you
are viewing Spherical Easel, you may wish to increase this contrast
between the front and the back using the <b>Front/Back Contrast</b>
menu item.
<p style="text-indent:0pt; font:plain 10pt sans-serif, Palatino">

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="constructions"> <h4>Constructions </h4>

<p> <img src="constructionmenu.gif" align=right hspace=10>
Once some elements have been defined in a figure, it is often desirable to
construct some other elements based on those.  
The Construction Menu, shown on the right, allows for some common
constructions.  As usual, the desired construction should first be
selected.  Instructions will appear that lead you through the
particular construction.

<p> Most of the constructions are straightforward.  Please note,
however, that when <b>Parallel transport</b> is selected followed by a
closed path of line segments, you will see a vector that may be
dragged along the path thus demonstrating the notion of parallel
transport.
<p style="text-indent:0pt; font:plain 10pt sans-serif, Palatino">
<a href="index.html"> Back to top </a>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="measurements"> <h4>Measurements </h4>

<p> <img src="measurementmenu.gif" align=left hspace=10> 
<p>Various
measurements may be made as indicated by the Measurement menu shown on
the left.  Again, most of these are fairly straightforward.  Please
note, however, that distances and angle measures are usually displayed
as multiples of <img src="pi.gif">.

<p> 
<img src="measurementframe.gif" align=right hspace=10>
When a measurement is made, a separate window containing the
measurements will appear.  This window may be hidden if desired.
Most windowing systems allow windows like this to be set so that they
will always stay on top of other windows.  Notice that, in keeping
with the spirit of Spherical Easel, the measurements will be updated
as elements in the figured are moved.

<br clear=all>

<p> <img src="calculator.gif" align=right hspace=10> 
The <b>Calculator</b> menu item allows you to study quantities that
depend on other measurements made.  This calculator, whose syntax is
modelled on Maple's, supports a wide range
of mathematical functions including the trigonometric,
logarithm and exponential functions.  Notice that each measurement is
given a label by which it may be referenced in an expression.

<p> Finally, measurements may be deleted by first selecting the
<b>Delete Measurement</b> menu item and then clicking on the desired
measurement. 
<p style="text-indent:0pt; font:plain 10pt sans-serif, Palatino">

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="isometries"> <h4>Isometries </h4>
<p> <img src="isometrymenu.gif" align=right hspace=10>
Spherical Easel allows you to work with the standard
isometries--reflections, translations and rotations--using the
Isometry Menu.  Generally speaking, you will be asked to select an
element, either a line or line segment or point, to define the
isometry.  Then you may select elements on which you want the isometry
to act.  

<p>
Please notice that the angle of rotation may be controlled by
moving the point on the rotation tool displayed.
