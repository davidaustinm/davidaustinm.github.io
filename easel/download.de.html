<ol style="text-indent:0pt; font-style:plain">
<p>
<li>
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
Java Web Start, a tool for downloading and managing software,
is freely available from Sun.  Its installation and use are quite
straightforward. 

<li> 
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
You will first need to download
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/download.html">Java
Web Start</a> from Sun.  This involves downloading a version of the
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and installing it.  In fact, you have
already done this if you have installed the Java Plug-In.

<p>
<li>
<p style="text-indent:0pt"> <b>Microsoft Windows users:</b> Java Web
Start is installed automatically when you install the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE).  In particular, if you have installed the Java
Plug-In for web browsers, you have already installed Java Web Start.
Most likely, there is a Java Web Start icon on your desktop and an
entry in your Start Menu.

<li> 
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
<b> Linux users:</b>  If you have installed the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE), you should look for a file like this one:
<center>
<pre>
/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_02/jre/javaws-1_2_0_02-linux-i586-i.zip
</pre>
</center>
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
Copy this file into an installation
directory, 
unzip it and run the
script <tt>install.sh</tt>.  Java Web Start is now an application
called <tt>javaws</tt> in a directory <tt>javaws</tt>.

<li>
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
The installation of <b>Spherical Easel</b> is started through the
link above.  Java Web Start should handle the installation and launch
<b>Spherical Easel</b>.  Again, you should ignore the warning that
installing <b>Spherical Easel</b> is unsafe.  To make this warning go
away requires a digital certificate, which is beyond the means of our
shoe-string operation.

<li> 
<p style="text-indent:0pt">
When you wish to open <b>Spherical Easel</b> in the future, you
may do so by opening Java Web Start and selecting the <b>Spherical
Easel</b> icon.  Windows users may start Web Start from the desktop or
Start Menu while Linux users will need to start it from the command
line.  Upon opening <b>Spherical Easel</b> for the second time,
Windows users will be asked whether to include a shortcut to
<b>Spherical Easel</b> on the desktop.
