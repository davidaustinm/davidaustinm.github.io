<p>Choosing the degree of the polynomial to be too high is called <em class="emphasis">overfitting</em>, a phenomenon that appears in many machine learning applications. Generally speaking, we would like to choose \(k\) large enough to capture the essential features of the data but not so large that we overfit and build the noise into the model.  There are ways to determine the optimal value of \(k\text{,}\) but we won't pursue that here.</p>
