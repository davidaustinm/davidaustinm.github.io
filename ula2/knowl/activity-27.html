<p>We can gain some intuition about this problem by graphing the quadratic form paying particular attention to the unit vectors.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Evaluating the following cell defines the matrix \(D = \begin{bmatrix}
3 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp -1
\end{bmatrix}\) and displays the graph of the associated quadratic form \(q_D(\xvec)\text{.}\)  In addition, the points corresponding to vectors \(\uvec\) with unit length are displayed as a curve. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-50"><script type="text/x-sage">x, y, t = var('x', 'y', 't')

A = matrix(2, 2, [3,0,0,-1])    

def q(x,y):
   return vector([x,y])*(A*vector([x,y]))
graph = plot3d(q(x,y), (x,-1.2,1.2), (y,-1.2,1.2), color='orange', opacity=0.9, aspect_ratio=(1,1,1/max(matrix(RDF, A).singular_values())))
curve = parametric_plot3d([cos(t), sin(t), q(cos(t), sin(t))], (t,0,2*pi), thickness=3)   
graph + curve
</script></div> Notice that the matrix \(D\) is diagonal.  In which directions does the quadratic form have its maximum and minimum values?</p></li>
<li><p>Write the quadratic form \(q_D\) associated to \(D\text{.}\)  What is the value of \(q_D\left(\twovec10\right)\text{?}\)  What is the value of \(q_D\left(\twovec01\right)\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a unit vector \(\uvec=\twovec{u_1}{u_2}\) so that \(u_1^2+u_2^2 =
1\text{,}\) an expression we can rewrite as \(u_1^2 =
1-u_2^2\text{.}\)  Write the quadratic form \(q_D(\uvec)\) and replace \(u_1^2\) by \(1-u_2^2\text{.}\)  Now explain why the maximum of \(q_D(\uvec)\) is 3.  In which direction does this occur?  Does this agree with what you observed by looking at the graph above?</p></li>
<li><p>Write the quadratic form \(q_D(\uvec)\) and replace \(u_2^2\) by \(1-u_1^2\text{.}\)  What is the minimum value of \(q_D(\uvec)\) and in which direction does this occur?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the previous Sage cell to change the matrix to \(A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 \amp 2 \\
2 \amp 1
\end{bmatrix}\) and display the graph of the quadratic form \(q_A(\xvec) = \xvec\cdot(A\xvec)\text{.}\) Determine the directions in which the maximum and minimum occur?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Remember that \(A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 \amp 2 \\
2 \amp 1
\end{bmatrix}\) is symmetric so that \(A=QDQ^T\) where \(D\) is the diagonal matrix above and \(Q\) is the orthogonal matrix that rotates vectors by \(45^\circ\text{.}\)  Write \(\vvec = Q^T\uvec\text{.}\) Explain why \(\vvec\) is also a unit vector;  that is, explain why</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\len{\vvec}^2 = \len{Q^T\uvec}^2 =
(Q^T\uvec)\cdot(Q^T\uvec) = 1.
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>We now have \(q_A(\uvec) = q_D(\vvec)\text{.}\)  Explain how we now know the maximum value of \(q_A(\uvec)\) is 3 and determine the direction in which this occurs.  Also, determine the minumum value of \(q_A(\uvec)\) and determine the direction in which this occurs.</p></li>
