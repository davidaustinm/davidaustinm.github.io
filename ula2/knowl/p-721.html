<p>The eigenvectors \(\uvec_j\) are called <em class="emphasis">principal components</em>, and we order them so their associated eigenvalues decrease.  Generally speaking, we hope that the first few principal components capture most of the variance.  In any case, adding more principal components captures more of the variance but at the expense of working with a higher dimensional subspace.  As we'll see later, we will seek a balance using a number of principal components large enough to capture most of the variance but small enough to be easy to work with.</p>
