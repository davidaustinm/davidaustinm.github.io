<p>This activity explores two further uses of the dot product beginning with the similarity of vectors.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Our first task is to assess the similarity between various Wikipedia articles by forming vectors from each of five articles.  In particular, one may download the text from articles on Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Super Bowl, remove common words, such as “the” and “then,” and count the number of times words appeared in each article.</p>
<p>To get a clearer sense, evaluate the following cell that loads in some special commands along with the Wikipedia data. For each of the five articles, you will see a list of the number of times 10 words appear in these articles.  For instance, the word “act” appears 3 times in the Veteran's Day article and 0 times in the Labor Day article. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-2"><script type="text/x-sage">sage.repl.load.load("http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/python/dot-similarity.py", globals())
events.head(int(10))
</script></div> For each of the five articles, we obtain 604-dimensional vectors, that are named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">veterans</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">memorial</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">labor</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">golden</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">super</code>.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Suppose that two articles have no words in common.  What is the value of the dot product between their corresponding vectors?  What does this say about the angle between these vectors?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose there are two articles on the same subject, yet one article is twice is long.  What approximate relationship would you expect to hold between the two vectors?  What does this say about the angle between them?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Sage cell below to find the angle between the vector <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">veterans</code> and the other four vectors.  To express the angle in degrees, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">degrees(x)</code> command, which gives the number of degrees in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code> radians. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-3"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the four angles you have found and discuss what they mean about the similarity between the Veteran's Day article and the other four.  Does your result reflect the nature of these five events?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vectors are often used to represent how a quantity changes over time.  For instance, the vector \(\svec=\fourvec{78.3}{81.2}{82.1}{79.0}\) might represent the value of a company's stock on four consecutive days. We call such a vector a <em class="emphasis">time series.</em>  Evaluate the Sage cell below to see a representation of two time series \(\svec_1\text{,}\) in blue, and \(\svec_2\text{,}\) in orange, which we may imagine represent the value of two stocks over a period of time. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-4"><script type="text/x-sage">series_plot(s1, 'blue') + series_plot(s2, 'orange')
</script></div> Even though one stock has a higher value than the other, the two appear to be related since they seem to rise and fall at roughly similar ways.  We often say that they are <em class="emphasis">correlated</em>, and we would like to measure the degree to which they are correlated.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>In order to compare the ways in which they rise and fall, we will first <em class="emphasis">demean</em> the time series;  that is, for each time series, we will subtract its average value to obtain a new time series.  There is a command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">demean(s)</code> that returns the demeaned time series of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">s</code>.  Use the Sage cell below to demean the series \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\) and plot.  (This cell relies on some data loaded by the first cell in this activity.) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-5"><script type="text/x-sage">ds1 = demean(s1)
ds2 = demean(s2)
series_plot(ds1, 'blue') + series_plot(ds2, 'orange')
</script></div></p></li>
<li>
<p>If the demeaned series are \(\tilde{\svec}_1\) and \(\tilde{\svec}_2\text{,}\) then the correlation between \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\) is defined to be</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\corr(\svec_1, \svec_2) =
\frac{\tilde{\svec}_1\cdot\tilde{\svec}_2}
{\len{\tilde{\svec}_1}\len{\tilde{\svec}_2}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given the geometric interpretation of the dot product, the correlation equals the cosine of the agle between the demeaned time series, and therefore \(\corr(\svec_1,\svec_2)\) is between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>Find the correlation between \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\text{.}\) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-6"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose that two time series are such that their demeaned time series are scalar multiples of one another, as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-correlation.html" title="Figure 1.1.9">Figure 1.1.9</a></p>
