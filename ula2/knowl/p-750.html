<p>Let's just focus on the contribution from \(\uvec_1\text{.}\)  We see that the ninth component of \(\uvec_1\text{,}\) the one that describes Fresh Fruit, is about -0.63.  This means that \(477\uvec_1\) differs from the mean by about \(477(-0.63) =
-300\) grams per person per week.  So roughly speaking, people in Northern Ireland are eating about 300 fewer grams of Fresh Fruit than the average across the three countries.  This is borne out by looking at the origin data, which shows that the consumption of Fresh Fruit in Northern Ireland is significantly less than the other nations.  Examing the other components of \(\uvec_1\) shows other categories in which Northern Ireland is significantly different.</p>
