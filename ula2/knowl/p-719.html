<p>Another way to think about this is to notice that the eigenvalue associated to the eigenvector \(\uvec_4\) is zero; this means that the variance of the data projected along the line defined by \(\uvec_4\) is zero so all the points project to the zero vector.  From this, we conclude that the data must lie in the orthogonal complement of \(\uvec_4\text{.}\) Similarly, the eigenvalue associated to \(\uvec_5\) is zero so the data must lie in the orthogonal complement of \(\uvec_5\) as well.  Since the data lies in the orthogonal complements of both \(\uvec_4\) and \(\uvec_5\text{,}\) it must lie in \(W_3\text{,}\) the three-dimensional subspace spanned by \(\uvec_1\text{,}\) \(\uvec_2\text{,}\) and \(\uvec_3\text{.}\)</p>
