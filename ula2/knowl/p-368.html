<p>Suppose we have three data points \((1,1)\text{,}\) \((2,1)\text{,}\) and \((3,3)\) and that we would like to find a line passing through them.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Plot these three points in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-ls-empty.html" title="Figure 1.5.1">Figure 1.5.1</a>.  Are you able to draw a line that passes through all three points? <figure class="figure-like"><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/empty-ls.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">1.5.1.</span> Plot the three data points here.</figcaption></figure></p></li>
<li>
<p>Let's write some conditions that would describe a line passing through the points.  Remember that the equation of a line can be written as \(y=b + mx\) where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.  We will try to find \(m\) and \(b\) so that the three points lie on the line.</p>
<p>The first data point \((1,1)\) will give us an equation for \(m\) and \(b\text{.}\)  In particular, we know that when \(x=1\text{,}\) then \(y=1\) so we have \(b + m(1) = 1\) or \(b + m = 1\text{.}\)  Use the other two data points to create a linear system describing \(m\) and \(b\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have obtained a linear system having three equations, one from each data point, for the two unknowns \(b\) and \(m\text{.}\) Identify a matrix \(A\) and vector \(\bvec\) so that the system has the form \(A\xvec=\bvec\text{,}\) where \(\xvec=\twovec bm\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a solution to this linear system?  How does this relate to your attempt to draw a line through the three points above?</p></li>
<li><p>Since this system is inconsistent, we know that \(\bvec\) is not in the column space \(\col(A)\text{.}\) Find an orthogonal basis for \(\col(A)\) and use it to find the orthogonal projection \(\widehat\bvec\) of \(\bvec\) onto \(\col(A)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(\widehat\bvec\) is in \(\col(A)\text{,}\) the equation \(A\xvec = \widehat\bvec\) is consistent.  Find its solution \(\xvec = \twovec{b}{m}\) and sketch the line \(y=b + mx\) in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-ls-empty.html" title="Figure 1.5.1">Figure 1.5.1</a>.  We say that this is the line of best fit.</p></li>
