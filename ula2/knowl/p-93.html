<p>The dot product allows us to determine the angle between two vectors.  As we move forward, we will be most interested in the situation where the vectors are orthogonal, which is detected when the dot product is zero.  More specifically, we will be interested in determining vectors that are orthogonal to all the vectors in a particular subspace.  For instance, if we're given a plane, a 2-dimensional subspace in \(\real^3\text{,}\) there is a line that runs perpendicularly to the plane, and we will need to be able to describe that line.</p>
