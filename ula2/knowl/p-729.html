<p>This example is a more realistic illustration of principal component analysis.  Starting with the \(3\times100\) matrix of demeaned data \(A\text{,}\) we construct the covariance matrix \(C=\frac{1}{100} ~AA^T\) and study its eigenvalues. Notice that the first two principal components account for more than 98% of the variance, which means we can expect the points to lie close to \(W_2\text{,}\) the two-dimensional subspace spanned by \(\uvec_1\) and \(\uvec_2\text{.}\)  In fact, the plot of the three-dimensional data appears to show that the data lies close to a plane.  The analysis we are performing helps us to identify that plane quantitatively.</p>
