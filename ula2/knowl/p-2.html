<p>In this chapter, we will expand this intuition by introducing an algebraic operation, known as the dot product, that helps us think of vectors as geometric objects that have length and that form angles.  As we will see, this tool will help us simplify the search for solutions to many linear systems.  In addition, it will provide a powerful tool, known as least squares, to find the best approximate solution when a linear system has no solution.</p>
