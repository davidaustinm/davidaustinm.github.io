<p>Suppose that we have a data set with \(N\) points and that \(A\) represents the demeaned data matrix.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Given a matrix \(B\text{,}\) of what matrix do the right singular vectors of \(B\) appear as eigenvectors?</p></li>
<li><p>If we have \(B=U\Sigma V^T\text{,}\) remember that \(B^T=V\Sigma^T U^T\text{.}\)  In other words, the left singular vectors of \(B\) are the right singular vectors of \(B^T\text{.}\)  Of what matrix do the left singular vectors of \(B\) appear as eigenvectors?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider now our demeaned data matrix and a singular value decomposition \(A=U\Sigma V^T\text{.}\)  Of what matrix do the left singular vectors, the columns of \(U\text{,}\) appear as eigenvectors?  Explain how this matrix is related to the covariance matrix \(C\text{.}\) Then explain why the columns of \(U\) are the principal components of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>How are the singular values of \(A\) related to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix \(C\text{.}\)  In particular, how is the variance \(V_{\uvec_j}\) expressed in terms of the singular values of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Let's revisit the iris data set that we studied in <a href="sec-pca.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Principal Component Analysis">Section 2.3</a>.  Remember that there are four measurements given for each of 150 irises.  The irises are grouped into three species of which there are 50 each.</p>
<p>Evaluating the following cell will load the demeaned data matrix \(A\) whose shape is \(4\times150\text{.}\) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-81"><script type="text/x-sage">sage.repl.load.load('http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/python/pca-iris.py', globals())
df.head()
</script></div></p>
<p>Find the singular values of \(A\) using the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A.singular_values()</code> and use them to determine the fraction of variance explained by the first two principal components. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-82"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now write the matrix \(\Gamma = \Sigma
V^T\) so that \(A = U\Gamma\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Suppoe that a demeaned data point, say, the 100th column of \(A\text{,}\) is written as a linear combination of principal components:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\xvec = c_1\uvec_1+c_2\uvec_2+c_3\uvec_3+c_4\uvec_4.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Explain why the vector \(\fourvec{c_1}{c_2}{c_3}{c_4}\) appears as 100th column of \(\Gamma\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let's now consider the approximation \(A_2=U_2\Sigma_2V_2^T\) of the demeaned data matrix \(A\text{,}\) which involves the first two principal components.  Explain why the 100th column of \(A_2\) represents the projection of \(\xvec\) onto the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the first two principal components, \(\uvec_1\) and \(\uvec_2\text{.}\)  Then explain why the coefficients in that projection, \(c_1\uvec_1 + c_2\uvec_2\text{,}\) form a two-dimensional vector \(\twovec{c_1}{c_2}\) that is the 100th column of \(\Gamma_2=\Sigma_2
V_2^T\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Now we've seen that the columns of \(\Gamma_2 =
\Sigma_2 V_2^T\) form the coordinates of the demeaned data points projected on the two-dimensional subspace spanned by \(\uvec_1\) and \(\uvec_2\text{.}\) In the cell below, find a singular value decomposition of \(A\) and use it to form the matrix <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Gamma2</code> below.  When you evaluate this cell, you will see a plot of the projected demeaned data plots, similar to the one we created in <a href="sec-pca.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Principal Component Analysis">Section 2.3</a>. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-83"><script type="text/x-sage"># Form the SVD of A and use it to form Gamma2

		    
Gamma2 = 

# The following will plot the projected demeaned data points
data = Gamma2.columns()
(list_plot(data[:50], color='blue', aspect_ratio=1) +
 list_plot(data[50:100], color='orange') +
 list_plot(data[100:], color='green'))
