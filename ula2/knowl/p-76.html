<p>Is there a way that we can determine which is the better of the two?  It feels like a better clustering will be one for which the points in a cluster are, on average, closer to the centroid of their cluster.  If we have a clustering, we therefore define a function, called the <em class="emphasis">objective</em>, which measures the average of the square of the distance from each point to the centroid of the cluster to which that point belongs.  A clustering with a smaller objective will have clusters more tightly centered around their centroids, which should result in a better clustering.</p>
