<p>Vectors are often used to represent how a quantity changes over time.  For instance, the vector \(\svec=\fourvec{78.3}{81.2}{82.1}{79.0}\) might represent the value of a company's stock on four consecutive days. We call such a vector a <em class="emphasis">time series.</em>  Evaluate the Sage cell below to see a representation of two time series \(\svec_1\text{,}\) in blue, and \(\svec_2\text{,}\) in orange, which we may imagine represent the value of two stocks over a period of time. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-4"><script type="text/x-sage">series_plot(s1, 'blue') + series_plot(s2, 'orange')
</script></div> Even though one stock has a higher value than the other, the two appear to be related since they seem to rise and fall at roughly similar ways.  We often say that they are <em class="emphasis">correlated</em>, and we would like to measure the degree to which they are correlated.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>In order to compare the ways in which they rise and fall, we will first <em class="emphasis">demean</em> the time series;  that is, for each time series, we will subtract its average value to obtain a new time series.  There is a command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">demean(s)</code> that returns the demeaned time series of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">s</code>.  Use the Sage cell below to demean the series \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\) and plot.  (This cell relies on some data loaded by the first cell in this activity.) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-5"><script type="text/x-sage">ds1 = demean(s1)
ds2 = demean(s2)
series_plot(ds1, 'blue') + series_plot(ds2, 'orange')
</script></div></p></li>
<li>
<p>If the demeaned series are \(\tilde{\svec}_1\) and \(\tilde{\svec}_2\text{,}\) then the correlation between \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\) is defined to be</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\corr(\svec_1, \svec_2) =
\frac{\tilde{\svec}_1\cdot\tilde{\svec}_2}
{\len{\tilde{\svec}_1}\len{\tilde{\svec}_2}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given the geometric interpretation of the dot product, the correlation equals the cosine of the agle between the demeaned time series, and therefore \(\corr(\svec_1,\svec_2)\) is between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>Find the correlation between \(\svec_1\) and \(\svec_2\text{.}\) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-6"><script type="text/x-sage">
