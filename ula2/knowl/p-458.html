<p>It's certainly true that higher degree polynomials fit the data better, as seen by the increasing values of \(R^2\text{,}\) but that's not always a good thing. For instance, when \(k=11\text{,}\) you may notice that the polynomial wiggles a little more than it should. In this case, the polynomial is trying too hard to fit the data, which usually has some errors in it, especially if it's obtained from measurements. The error built in to the data is called <em class="emphasis">noise,</em> and acknowledging its presence means that we shouldn't expect our polynomial to fit the data perfectly. When we choose a polynomial whose degree is too high, we give the noise too much weight in the model, which leads to some undesirable behavior, like the wiggles in the graph.</p>
