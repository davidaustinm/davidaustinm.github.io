<p>Let's now recall our motivating question:  in which direction \(\uvec\) is the variance of a dataset as large as possible and in which is it as small as possible.  Remembering that the vector \(\uvec\) is a unit vector, we can now state a more general form of this question: <em class="emphasis">If \(q(\xvec)\) is a quadratic form, for which unit vectors	\(\uvec\) is \(q(\uvec)\) as large as possible and for which is it as small as possible?</em> Since a unit vector specifies a direction, we will often ask for the directions in which the quadratic form \(q(\xvec)\) is at its maximum or minimum value.</p>
