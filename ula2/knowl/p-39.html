<li><p>Suppose that two articles have no words in common.  What is the value of the dot product between their corresponding vectors?  What does this say about the angle between these vectors?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose there are two articles on the same subject, yet one article is twice is long.  What approximate relationship would you expect to hold between the two vectors?  What does this say about the angle between them?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Sage cell below to find the angle between the vector <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">veterans</code> and the other four vectors.  To express the angle in degrees, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">degrees(x)</code> command, which gives the number of degrees in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code> radians. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-3"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the four angles you have found and discuss what they mean about the similarity between the Veteran's Day article and the other four.  Does your result reflect the nature of these five events?</p></li>
