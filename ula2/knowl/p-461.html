<p>This section introduced some types of least squares problems and a framework for working with them.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Given an inconsistent system \(A\xvec=\bvec\text{,}\) we find \(\xhat\text{,}\) the least squares approximate solution, by requiring that \(A\xhat\) be as possible to \(\bvec\) as possible.  In other words, \(A\xhat = \bhat\) where \(\bhat\) is the orthogonal projection of \(\bvec\) onto \(\col(A)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>One way to find \(\xhat\) is by solving the normal equations \(A^TA\xhat = A^T\bvec.\)  This is not our preferred method since numerical issues can arise when constructing \(A^TA\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>A second way to find \(\xhat\) uses a \(QR\) factorization of \(A\text{.}\)  If \(A=QR\text{,}\) then \(\xhat
= R^{-1}Q^T\bvec\) and finding \(R^{-1}\) is computationally feasible since \(R\) is upper triangular.</p></li>
<li><p>This technique may be applied widely and is useful for modeling data.  We saw examples in this section where linear functions of several input variables and polynomials provided effective models for various datasets.  A simple measure of the quality of the fit is the coefficient of determination \(R^2\) though some additional thought should be given in real applications.</p></li>
