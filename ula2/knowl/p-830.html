<p>As we said earlier, the singular value decomposition should be thought of a generalization of orthogonal diagonalizations. For instance, the Spectral Theorem tells us that a symmetric matrix can be written as \(QDQ^T\text{.}\)  Many matrices, however, are not symmetric and so they are not orthogonally diagonalizable.  However, every matrix has a singular value decomposition \(U\Sigma V^T\text{.}\)  The cost of this generalization is that we usually have two different orthogonal matrices \(U\) and \(V\) whereas we have only one orthogonal matrix \(Q\) in an orthogonal diagonalization.</p>
