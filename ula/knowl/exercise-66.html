<p>Suppose that a company has three plants, called Plants 1, 2, and 3, that produce milk \(M\) and yogurt \(Y\text{.}\)  For every hour of operation,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Plant \(1\) produces 20 units of milk and 15 units of yogurt.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant \(2\) produces 30 units of milk and 5 units of yogurt.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant \(3\) produces 0 units of milk and 40 units of yogurt.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that \(x_1\text{,}\) \(x_2\text{,}\) and \(x_3\) record the amounts of time that the three plants are operated. Find expressions for the number of units of milk \(M\) and yogurt \(Y\) produced.</p></li>
<li><p>If we write \(\xvec=\threevec{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\) and \(\yvec = \twovec{M}{Y}\text{,}\) find the matrix \(A\) that defines the matrix transformation \(T(\xvec) =
\yvec\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, suppose that producing each unit of</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>milk requires 5 units of electricity and 8 units of labor.</p></li>
<li><p>yogurt requires 6 units of electricity and 10 units of labor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Write expressions for the required amounts of electricity \(E\) and labor \(L\) in terms of \(M\) and \(Y\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we write the vector \(\zvec = \twovec{E}{L}\) to record the required amounts of electricity and labor, find the matrix \(B\) that defines the matrix transformation \(S(\yvec) =
\zvec\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(\xvec = \threevec{30}{20}{10}\) describes the amounts of time that the three plants are operated, how much milk and yogurt is produced?  How much electricity and labor are required?</p></li>
<li><p>Find the matrix \(C\) that describes the matrix transformation \(R(\xvec)=\zvec\) that gives the required amounts of electricity and labor when the plants are operated times given by vector \(\xvec\text{.}\)</p></li>
