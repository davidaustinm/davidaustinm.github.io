<p>When a linear system has a unique solution, every column of the coefficient matrix has a pivot position.  Since every row contains at most one pivot position, there must be at least as many rows as columns in the coefficient matrix.  Therefore, the linear system has at least as many equations as unknowns, which is something we intuitively suspected in <a href="sec-expect.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: What can we expect">SectionÂ 1.1</a>.</p>
