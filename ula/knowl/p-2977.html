<p>In <a href="sec-matrix-inverse.html#subsec-triangular-invertible" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.1.3: Triangular matrices and Gaussian elimination">SubsectionÂ 3.1.3</a>, we saw how to describe the three row operations, scaling, interchange, and row replacement, using matrix multiplication.  Remember that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Scalings are performed by multiplying by a diagonal matrix, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which has the effect of multiplying the second row by \(3\text{.}\)  Since \(S\) is diagonal, we know that its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries so that \(\det S = 3\text{.}\)  If we scale a row in \(A\) by \(3\) to obtain the matrix \(A'\text{,}\) then we have \(SA=A'\text{,}\) which means that \(\det S\det A = \det A'\text{.}\)  Therefore, \(3\det A
= \det A'\text{.}\)  In general, if we scale a row of \(A\) by \(s\) to obtain \(A'\text{,}\) we have \(s\det A=\det A'\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interchanges are performed by matrices such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which has the effect of interchanging the first and second rows.  Notice that the determinant of this matrix is \(\det P = -1\) since it defines a reflection.  Therefore, if we perform an interchange operation on \(A\) to obtain \(A'\text{,}\) we have \(PA=A'\text{,}\) which means that \(\det P \det A = \det A'\text{.}\)  In other words, we have \(-\det A = \det A'\) so that the determinant before and after an interchange have opposite signs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Row replacement operations are performed by matrices such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
R = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
-2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which multiplies the first row by \(-2\) and adds the result to the third row.  Since this is a lower triangular matrix, we know that the determinant is the product of diagonal entries, which says that \(\det R = 1\text{.}\)  If we perform a row replacement on \(A\) to obtain \(A'\text{,}\) then \(RA = A'\) and therefore \(\det R \det A = \det A'\text{,}\) which means that \(\det A = \det A'\text{.}\)  In other words, the determinants before and after a row replacement operation are equal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
