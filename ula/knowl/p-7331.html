<p>Let's now return to our motivating question:  in which direction <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is the variance <span class="process-math">\(V_{\uvec}=\uvec\cdot(C\uvec)\)</span> of a dataset as large as possible and in which is it as small as possible.  Remembering that the vector <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is a unit vector, we can now state a more general form of this question: <em class="emphasis">If <span class="process-math">\(q_A(\xvec)\)</span> is a quadratic form, for which unit vectors	<span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(q_A(\uvec)=\uvec\cdot(A\uvec)\)</span> as large as possible and for which is it as small as possible?</em> Since a unit vector specifies a direction, we will often ask for the directions in which the quadratic form <span class="process-math">\(q(\xvec)\)</span> is at its maximum or minimum value.</p>
