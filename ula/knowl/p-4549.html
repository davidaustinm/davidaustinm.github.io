<p>We begin with the vector \(\xvec_0 =
\threevec{0.4}{0.3}{0.3}\text{,}\) the entries of which represent the percentage of voters voting for each of the three parties.  Since every voter votes for one of the three parties, the sum of these entries must be 1, which means that \(\xvec_0\) is a probability vector. We then find that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccc}
\xvec_1=\threevec{0.240}{0.420}{0.340},\amp
\xvec_2=\threevec{0.212}{0.416}{0.372},\amp
\xvec_3=\threevec{0.202}{0.409}{0.389},\amp 
\ldots,\\ \\
\xvec_5=\threevec{0.199}{0.400}{0.401},\amp
\ldots,\amp
\xvec_{10}=\threevec{0.200}{0.400}{0.400},\amp
\ldots \\
\end{array}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that the vectors \(\xvec_k\) are also probability vectors and that the sequence \(\xvec_k\) seems to be converging to \(\threevec{0.2}{0.4}{0.4}\text{.}\)  It is this behavior that we would like to understand more fully by investigating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(A\text{.}\)</p>
