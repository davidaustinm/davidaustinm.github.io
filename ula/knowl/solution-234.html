<li><p>We find that \(C\) has eigenvalues \(\lambda_1=1\) and \(\lambda_2 = -\frac12\) with eigenvectors \(\vvec_1=\twovec12\) and \(\vvec_2 =
\twovec{-1}{1}\text{.}\)  Therefore, the unique steady-state vector is \(\qvec=\twovec{\frac13}{\frac23}\) for this is the only probability vector in the eigenspace \(E_1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We see that the Markov chain converges to the steady-state vector \(\qvec=\twovec{\frac13}{\frac23}\) as the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us to expect.</p></li>
<li><p>Another Markov chain converges to the unique steady-state vector \(\qvec=\twovec{\frac13}{\frac23}\) as the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us to expect.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix \(D\) is not positive because the first two entries in the bottom row of any power \(D^k\) are zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1=1\text{,}\) which has multiplicity two, and \(\lambda_2=-1\text{.}\)  The eigenspace \(E_1\) is two-dimensional and spanned by the probability vectors \(\qvec_1=\threevec{\frac13}{\frac23}0\) and \(\qvec_2=\threevec001\text{.}\)  Both of these vectors are steady-state vectors so there is not a unique steady-state vector.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(\xvec_0=\threevec100\text{,}\) then the Markov chain converges to \(\qvec_1=\threevec{\frac13}{\frac23}0\text{.}\)  If \(\xvec_0=\threevec001\text{,}\) then the Markov chain converges to \(\qvec_1=\threevec001\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Because \(C\) is a positive matrix, the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us that there is a unique steady-state vector to which any Markov chain will converge.  Because \(D\) is not a positive matrix, the Perron-Frobenius theorem does not tell us anything, and, indeed, we see that there is not a unique steady-state vector and different Markov chains can converge to different vectors.</p></li>
