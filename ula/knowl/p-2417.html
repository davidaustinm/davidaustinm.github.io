<p>Sometimes, however, it is more natural to work in a different coordinate system.  Suppose, for instance, that you live in the city whose map is shown in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-city-map.html" title="Figure 3.2.1">FigureÂ 3.2.1</a> and that you would like to give a guest directions for getting from your house to the store.  You would probably say something like, "Go four blocks up Maple.  Then turn left on Main for three blocks." The grid of streets in the city gives a more natural coordinate system than standard north-south, east-west coordinates.</p>
