<p>When presented with a square matrix \(A\text{,}\) we have typically found its eigenvalues as the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A-\lambda I) = 0\) and the associated eigenvectors as the null space \(\nul(A-\lambda I)\text{.}\) Unfortunately, this approach is not practical when we are working with large matrices. First, finding the charactertic polynomial of a large matrix requires considerable computation, as does finding the roots of that polynomial. Second, finding the null space of a singular matrix is plagued by numerical problems, as we will see in the preview activity.</p>
