<p>Let's consider an example that illustrates how we can put these ideas to use.</p>
<p>Suppose that we work for a car rental company that has two locations, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  When a customer rents a car at one location, they have the option to return it to either location at the end of the day.  After doing some market research, we determine:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>80% of the cars rented at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and 20% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>40% of the cars rented at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and 60% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that there are 1000 cars at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and no cars at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> on Monday morning.  How many cars are there are locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at the end of the day on Monday?</p></li>
<li><p>How many are at locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at end of the day on Tuesday?</p></li>
<li>
<p>If we let <span class="process-math">\(P_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_k\)</span> be the number of cars at locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> respectively, at the end of day <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> we then have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
P_{k+1}\amp {}={} 0.8P_k + 0.6Q_k \\
Q_{k+1}\amp {}={} 0.2P_k + 0.4Q_k\text{.} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We can write the vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_k = \twovec{P_k}{Q_k}\)</span> to reflect the number of cars at the two locations at the end of day <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> which says that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\xvec_{k+1} =
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.8 \amp 0.6 \\
0.2 \amp 0.4 \\

\xvec_k

</div>
<p class="continuation">or <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}0.8 \amp 0.6 \\ 0.2 \amp 0.4
\end{array}\right]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vvec_1 = \twovec{3}{1},
\qquad
\vvec_2 = \twovec{-1}{1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Compute <span class="process-math">\(A\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\vvec_2\)</span> to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\)</span> are eigenvectors of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> What are the associated eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2\text{?}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>We said that 1000 cars are initially at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and none at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  This means that the initial vector describing the number of cars is <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_0 =
\ctwovec{1000}{0}\text{.}\)</span>  Write <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_0\)</span> as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Remember that <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\)</span> are eigenvectors of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  Use the linearity of matrix multiplication to write the vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_1 =
A\xvec_0\text{,}\)</span> describing the number of cars at the two locations at the end of the first day, as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Write the vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_2 = A\xvec_1\)</span> as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\text{.}\)</span>  Then write the next few vectors as linear combinations of <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\text{:}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\xvec_3 = A\xvec_2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>

<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\xvec_6 = A\xvec_5\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What will happen to the number of cars at the two locations after a very long time?  Explain how writing <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_0\)</span> as a linear combination of eigenvectors helps you determine the long-term behavior.</p></li>
