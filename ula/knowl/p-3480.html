<p>This definition has an important geometric interpretation that we will investigate here.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that \(\vvec\) is a nonzero vector and that \(\lambda\) is a scalar.  What is the geometric relationship between \(\vvec\) and \(\lambda\vvec\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let's now consider the eigenvector condition: \(A\vvec = \lambda\vvec\text{.}\)  Here we have two vectors, \(\vvec\) and \(A\vvec\text{.}\)  If \(A\vvec =
\lambda\vvec\text{,}\) what is the geometric relationship between \(\vvec\) and \(A\vvec\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>EIGENVECTORS</p>
<p>Choose the matrix \(A=
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
1\amp 2 \\
2\amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{.}\) Move the vector \(\vvec\) so that the eigenvector condition holds.  What is the eigenvector \(\vvec\) and what is the associated eigenvalue?</p>
</li>
<li><p>By algebraically computing \(A\vvec\text{,}\) verify that the eigenvector condition holds for the vector \(\vvec\) that you found.</p></li>
<li><p>If you multiply the eigenvector \(\vvec\) that you found by \(2\text{,}\) do you still have an eigenvector?  If so, what is the associated eigenvalue?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you able to find another eigenvector \(\vvec\) that is not a scalar multiple of the first one that you found? If so, what is the eigenvector and what is the associated eigenvalue?</p></li>
<li><p>Now consider the matrix \(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
2 \amp 1 \\
0 \amp 2 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{.}\) Use the diagram to describe any eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, consider the matrix \(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 \amp -1 \\
1 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{.}\) Use the diagram to describe any eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues.  What geometric transformation does this matrix perform on vectors?  How does this explain the presence of any eigenvectors?</p></li>
