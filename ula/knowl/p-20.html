<p><em class="emphasis">There are frequent embedded Sage cells that help develop students' computational proficiency.</em>  The impact that linear algebra is having on our society is inextricably tied to the phenomenal increase in computing power witnessed in the last half-century.  Indeed, Carl Cowen, former president of the Mathematical Association of America, has said, “No serious application of linear algebra happens without a computer.” This means that an understanding of linear algebra is not complete without an understanding of how important quantities are practically computed.</p>
