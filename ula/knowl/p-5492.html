<li><p>If there are no words in common, then the dot product between the two vectors will be zero.  This means that they are perpendicular to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>The vectors should be, at least approximately, scalar multiples of one another, which means that the angle between them is zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The angle veterans makes with memorial is <span class="process-math">\(46.4^\circ\text{,}\)</span> with labor is <span class="process-math">\(59.2^\circ\text{,}\)</span> with golden is <span class="process-math">\(86.2^\circ\text{,}\)</span> and with super is <span class="process-math">\(86.4^\circ\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>It appears that the articles on Veteran's Day and Memorial Day are most similar.  This makes sense because both are U.S. national holidays that honor military service.  The second most similar article is Labor Day, which is also a national holiday.  The other two are quite dissimilar as they are entertainment events.</p></li>
