<p>The interactive diagram we used in the activity is meant to convey the fact that the eigenvectors of a matrix \(A\) are special vectors.  Most of the time, the vectors \(\vvec\) and \(A\vvec\) appear somewhat unrelated.  For certain vectors, however, \(\vvec\) and \(A\vvec\) line up with one another. Something important is going on when that happens so we call attention to those vectors by calling them eigenvectors. For these vectors, the operation of multiplying by \(A\) reduces to the much simpler operation of scalar multiplying by \(\lambda\text{.}\)  The reason eigenvectors are important is because it is extremely convenient to be able to replace matrix multiplication by scalar multiplication.</p>
