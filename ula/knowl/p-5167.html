<p>We returned to Gaussian elimination, which we have used as a primary tool for finding solutions to linear systems, and explored its practicality, both in terms of numerical accuracy and computational effort.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We saw that the accuracy of computations implemented on a computer could be improved using <em class="emphasis">partial pivoting</em>, a technique that performs row interchanges so that the entry in a pivot position has the largest possible magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Beginning with a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we used the Gaussian elimination algorithm to write <span class="process-math">\(PA = LU\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a permutation matrix, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is lower triangular, and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is upper triangular.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding this factorization involves roughly as much work as performing Gaussian elimination.  However, once we have the factorization, we are able to quickly solve equations of the form <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec = \bvec\)</span> by first solving <span class="process-math">\(L\cvec =
P\bvec\)</span> and then <span class="process-math">\(U\xvec = \cvec\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
