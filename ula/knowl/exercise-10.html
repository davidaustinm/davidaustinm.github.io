<p>The fuel inside model rocket motors is a black powder mixture that ideally consists of 60% charcoal, 30% potassium nitrate, and 10% sulfur by weight.</p>
<p>Suppose you work at a company that makes model rocket motors.  When you come into work one morning, you learn that yesterday's first shift made a perfect batch of fuel.  The second shift, however, misread the recipe and used 50% charcoal, 20% potassium nitrate and 30% sulfur.  Then the two batches were mixed together.  A chemical analysis shows that there are 100.3 pounds of charcoal in the mixture and 46.9 pounds of potassium nitrate.</p>
