<p>Notice that page \(2\) receives half of the PageRank from pages \(1\) and \(3\text{.}\)  This means that \(x_2=\frac12x_2+\frac12x_3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Also, page \(3\) receives half of the PageRank from page \(1\) and none from page \(2\) so we have \(x_3=\frac12 x_1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>This means that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
x_1 \amp {}={} \amp \amp \amp x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp
\frac12x_3 \\
x_2 \amp {}={} \amp \frac12x_1\amp \amp \amp {}+{} \amp
\frac12x_3 \\
x_3 \amp {}={} \amp \frac12x_1\amp \amp \amp \amp\text{.} \\
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>From the equations, we see that \(G=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 1 \amp \frac12 \\
\frac12 \amp 0 \amp \frac12 \\
\frac12 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>All of the entries of \(G\) are nonnegative and the columns each add to \(1\text{.}\)  This tells us that \(G\) is stochastic.</p></li>
<li><p>We see that \(\lambda_1=1\) is an eigenvalue and that the eigenspace \(E_1\) is spanned by \(\threevec432\text{.}\)  The unique steady-state vector is then \(\qvec=\threevec{\frac49}{\frac39}{\frac29}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Page \(1\) is assessed to have the highest quality because its PageRank \(x_1=\frac49\) is the largest.  This makes sense as a reflection of the structure of this Internet.  Since Page \(2\) only links to Page \(1\) and not Page \(3\text{,}\) it is not as useful as Page \(1\text{.}\)  Furthermore, Page \(3\) only has one incoming link so it is not viewed by Page \(2\) as being useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Since all the entries of \(G^4\) are positive, we can conclude that \(G\) is a positive matrix.  The Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us there is a unique steady-state vector, which we have already seen, and that any Markov chain will converge to it.</p></li>
<li><p>We verify that the Markov chain converges to the unique steady-state vector \(\qvec=\threevec{\frac49}{\frac39}{\frac29}\text{.}\)</p></li>
