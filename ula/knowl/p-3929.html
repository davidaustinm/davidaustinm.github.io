<p>As we have investigated eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices in this chapter, we have frequently asked whether we can find a basis of eigenvectors, as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/question-eigen-basis.html" title="Question 4.1.7">Question 4.1.7</a>.  In fact, <a data-knowl="./knowl/prop-eigen-basis.html" title="Proposition 4.2.3">Proposition 4.2.3</a> tells us that if \(A\) is an \(n\times n\) matrix having distinct and real eigenvalues, then there is a basis for \(\real^n\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\text{.}\)  There are, in addition, other conditions on \(A\) that guarantee such a basis, as we will see in subsequent chapters, but for now, suffice it to say that for many matrices, we can find a basis of eigenvectors. We will now see how such a matrix \(A\) is equivalent to a diagonal matrix \(D\text{.}\)</p>
