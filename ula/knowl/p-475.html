<p>Suppose you work at a company that makes model rocket motors.  When you come into work one morning, you learn that yesterday's first shift made a perfect batch of fuel.  The second shift, however, misread the recipe and used 50% charcoal, 20% potassium nitrate and 30% sulfur.  Then the two batches were mixed together.  A chemical analysis shows that there are 100.3 pounds of charcoal in the mixture and 46.9 pounds of potassium nitrate.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assuming the first shift produced <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> pounds of fuel and the second <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> pounds, set up a linear system in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  How many pounds of fuel did the first shift produce and how many did the second shift produce? <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-17"><script type="text/x-sage">
