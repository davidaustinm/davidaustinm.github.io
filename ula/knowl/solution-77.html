<li><p>Yes.  If \(c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 = \zerovec\) and one of the weights is not zero, we can rearrange this expression to solve for one of the vectors as a scalar multiple of the other.  For instance, if \(2\vvec_1-3\vvec_2=\zerovec\text{,}\) then \(\vvec_1 = \frac32\vvec_2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Any subset of the vectors forms a linearly independent set. Because the original set is linearly independent, none of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.  This is still true when we look at a smaller set of the vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>The set of vectors \(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n,\bvec\) will also be linearly independent.  Since \(A\xvec=\bvec\) is inconsistent, we know that \(\bvec\) cannot be written as a linear combination of the other vectors.  We also know that each of the vectors \(\vvec_j\) cannot be written as a linear combination of the others because \(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n\) is a linearly independent set.</p></li>
