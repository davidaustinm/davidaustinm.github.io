<li><p>No.  If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has two identical columns, then the columns are not linearly independent.  This means there is a column without a pivot position and so <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not row equivalent to the identity matrix <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>No.  If we perform a replacement operation that multiplies one of the equal rows by <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and adds it to the other equal row, we obtain a matrix having a row whose entries are all zero.  This says that the reduced row echelon form has such a row as well.  Therefore, there is a row that does not contain a pivot position so the reduced row echelon form cannot be the identity <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Yes.  If we multiply both sides of <span class="process-math">\(AB=AC\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> on the left, then we see that <span class="process-math">\(B=C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The inverse <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> is also invertible since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is its inverse.  Therefore, the span of the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\real^n\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Yes.  Since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is row equivalent to the identity matrix <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> the matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is as well.  Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is invertible.</p></li>
