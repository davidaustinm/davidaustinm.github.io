<p>To put this into context, imagine we need to solve a linear system with a trillion equations and a trillion unknowns and that we had a computer that could perform a trillion, \(10^{12}\text{,}\) operations every second.  Finding the reduced row echelon form would take about \(10^{16}\) years.  At this time, the universe is estimated to be approximately \(10^{10}\) years old.  If we started the calculation when the universe was born, we'd be about one-millionth of the way through.</p>
