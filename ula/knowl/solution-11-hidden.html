<li><p>It doesn't tell us anything.  The equation is true for any values of the variables.  Therefore, it does not provide a restriction on the solution space.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be an equation having the form \(0=1\) so there is a row whose leading entry is in the rightmost column of the augmented matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>First, we know there are solutions so no row can have its leading entry in the rightmost column of the augmented matrix. Second, there must be a free variable to have infinitely many solutions.  Therefore, there must be at least one column that corresponds to a variable that does not contain the leading entry of a row.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be infinitely many solutions since there will be a free variable.</p></li>
