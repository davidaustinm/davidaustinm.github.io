<p>Students in a school are sometimes absent due to an illness.  Suppose that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>95% of the students who attend school will attend school the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>50% of the students are absent one day will be absent the next day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will record the number of present students \(p\) and the number of absent students \(a\) in a state vector \(\xvec=\twovec{p}{a}\text{.}\)  On Tuesday, the state vector is \(\xvec=\ctwovec{1700}{100}\text{.}\)  The state vector evolves from one day to the next according to the transition function \(T:\real^2\to\real^2\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose we initially have 1000 students who are present and none absent.  Find \(T\left(\ctwovec{1000}{0}\right)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose we initially have 1000 students who are absent and none present.  Find \(T\left(\ctwovec{0}{1000}\right)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the results of parts a and b to find the matrix \(A\) that defines the matrix transformation \(T\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(\xvec=\ctwovec{1700}{100}\) on Tuesday, how are the students distributed on Wednesday?</p></li>
<li><p>How many students were present on Monday?</p></li>
<li><p>How many students are present on the following Tuesday?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens to the number of students who are present after a very long time?</p></li>
