<p>To see this explicitly, shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-jpeg-luminance.html" title="Figure 3.3.4">Figure 3.3.4</a> is the original image and the image as rendered with only the luminance.  That is, on the right, the color of each pixel is represented by only one byte, which is the luminance. This image essentially looks like a grayscale version of the original image with all its visual detail.  In fact, before digital television became the standard, television signals were broadcast using the <span class="process-math">\(YC_bC_r\)</span> color model.  When a signal was displayed on a black-and-white television, the luminance was displayed and the two chrominance values simply ignored.</p>
