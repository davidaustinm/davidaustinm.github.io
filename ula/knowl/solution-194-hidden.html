<li><p>There is a single eigenvalue \(\lambda=2\) and \(\dim E_2=1\) so it is not possible to find a basis for \(\real^2\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>The three eigenvalues each have multiplicity one so we know that their eigenspaces are one-dimensional.  We find a basis vector for \(E_3\) is \(\threevec100\text{,}\) for \(E_4\) is \(\threevec{-1}10\text{,}\) and for \(E_{-6}\) is \(\threevec10{-3}\text{.}\)  A basis for \(\real^3\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\) is therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\threevec100, \threevec{-1}{1}0, \threevec10{-3}
\right\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Since \(A-(-2)I\) is the zero matrix, every vector is an eigenvector of \(A\text{.}\)  This means that \(\left\{\twovec10, \twovec01\right\}\) is a basis of \(\real^2\) consisting of eigenvectors.</p></li>
<li><p>The multiplicity of each eigenvalue is one so there will be a basis of \(\real^2\) consisting of eigenvectors. In particular, a basis vector for \(E_3\) is \(\twovec12\) and a basis vector for \(E_{-2}\) is \(\twovec{-2}1\text{.}\)  This means that \(\left\{\twovec12,\twovec{-2}1\right\}\) is a basis for \(\real^2\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
