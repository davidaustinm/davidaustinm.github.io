<dt>Existence</dt>
<dd><p>In the previous section, we asked if we could write a vector \(\bvec\) as a linear combination of the columns of \(A\text{,}\) which happens precisely when a solution to the equation \(A\xvec = \bvec\) exists.  We saw that every vector \(\bvec\) could be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of \(A\) when \(A\) has a pivot position in every row.  In this case, we said that the span of the vectors \(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n\) is \(\real^m\text{.}\)  We saw that at least \(m\) vectors are needed to span \(\real^m\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>Uniqueness</dt>
<dd><p>In this section, we studied the uniqueness of solutions to the equation \(A\xvec = \zerovec\text{,}\) which is always consistent.  When a nontrivial solution exists, we saw that one vector of the set \(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n\) is a linear combination of the others, in which case we said that the set of vectors is linearly dependent.  This happens when the matrix \(A\) has a column without a pivot position.  We saw that there can be no more than \(m\) vectors in a set of linearly independent vectors in \(\real^m\text{.}\)</p></dd>
