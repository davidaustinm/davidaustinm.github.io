<p>which shows that the vectors are not linearly independent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the reduced row echelon form, we see that \(\vvec_3 = 2\vvec_1-\vvec_2\text{.}\)  This means that any linear combination of \(\vvec_1\text{,}\) \(\vvec_2\text{,}\) and \(\vvec_3\) can be written as a linear combination of \(\vvec_1\) and \(\vvec_2\) alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The reduced row echelon form of \(A\) shows that \(\vvec_1\) and \(\vvec_2\) are linearly independent. We also know that these two vectors span \(\col(A)\text{.}\) Therefore, they form a basis for \(\col(A)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The reduced row echelon form shows that \(\vvec_2=2\vvec_1\text{,}\) \(\vvec_3=0\vvec_1\text{,}\) and \(\vvec_4 = -3\vvec_1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(\vvec_2\text{,}\) \(\vvec_3\text{,}\) and \(\vvec_4\) can be written as a linear combination of \(\vvec_1\text{,}\) any linear combination of \(\vvec_1\text{,}\) \(\vvec_2\text{,}\) \(\vvec_3\text{,}\) and \(\vvec_4\) can be written as a linear combination of \(\vvec_1\) alone.  This means that \(\vvec_1\) forms a basis for \(\col(A)\text{,}\) which is then the line consisting of all scalar multiples of \(\vvec_1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The number of vectors in a basis of \(\col(A)\) equals the number of columns that have pivot positions. This says that \(\dim~\col(A) = \rank(A)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using what we have seen earlier, we know that \(\dim~\col(A) + \dim~\nul(A) = n\text{,}\) where \(n\) is the number of columns of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(A\) is invertible, then it has a pivot position in every row, which means that the columns span \(\real^9\text{.}\)  Therefore, \(\col(A) =
\real^9\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, every linear combination of the columns of \(A\) is the zero vector.  This can only happen if every column is itself the zero vector, which means that every entry in \(A\) is zero.</p></li>
