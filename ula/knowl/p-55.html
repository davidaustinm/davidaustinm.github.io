<p>It seems reasonable to wonder if the number of solutions depends on whether the number of equations is less than, equal to, or greater than the number of unknowns.  Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-exceptions.html" title="Figure 1.1.2">FigureÂ 1.1.2</a>.  For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution.  However, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.</p>
