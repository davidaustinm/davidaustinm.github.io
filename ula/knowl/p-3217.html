<li><p>The matrix <span class="process-math">\(U_1\)</span> is invertible because we see there is a pivot position in every row and column.  The matrix <span class="process-math">\(U_2\text{,}\)</span> however, is not invertible because there is not a pivot position in the third row.</p></li>
<li><p>The determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.  Consequently, if the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is not zero, then each of its diagonal entries must be nonzero.  In this case, there is a pivot position in every row and every column so that the matrix is invertible.</p></li>
<li><p>Row replacement operations do not change the determinant so <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) = \det(A_1)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In the same way, <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) =
\det(A_2)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Interchanges change the sign of the determinant so <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) = -\det(U)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The determinant <span class="process-math">\(\det(U) = -4\)</span> since it is the product of the diagonal entries of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span>  This means that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) = 4\text{.}\)</span>  We see that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible because <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> which has a pivot position in every row and every column, is invertible.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Beginning with a row replacement operation, we arrive at</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A_1=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
0 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\
0 \amp -3 \amp 3 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We next scale the second row by <span class="process-math">\(\frac12\)</span> to obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A_2=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
0 \amp -3 \amp 3 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Another row replacement operation gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A_3=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Putting these operations together, we see that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) = 2\det(U) = 0\text{.}\)</span>  In this case, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not invertible because <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> which has a row without a pivot position, is not invertible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performing one of the three row operations either leaves the determinant unchanged (row replacement), changes its sign (interchange), or multiplies it by a nonzero number (scaling).  Therefore, if we begin with a matrix whose determinant is not zero, the determinant remains not zero after any row operation is applied.</p></li>
<li><p>If we apply a sequence of row operations to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to find a row equivalent matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> that is upper triangular, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A)\neq0\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\det(U) \neq 0\text{.}\)</span> We also know that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible if and only if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is invertible.  Putting these facts together, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A)\neq 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible.</p></li>
