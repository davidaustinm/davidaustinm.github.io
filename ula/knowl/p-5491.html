<li><p>It appears that the articles on Veteran's Day and Memorial Day are most similar.  This makes sense because both are U.S. national holidays that honor military service.  The second most similar article is Labor Day, which is also a national holiday.  The other two are quite dissimilar as they are entertainment events.</p></li>
