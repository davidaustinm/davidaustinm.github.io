<p>Now we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}

<p class="continuation">The population of species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not influenced by species <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>  However, we see that the population of species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> grows in the presence of species <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> In other words, species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> helps species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to grow so we say that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is beneficial for <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Because the eigenvalues are <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=0.7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=1.6\text{,}\)</span> this dynamical system is again a saddle.  The associated eigenvectors are <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1=\twovec10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2=\twovec13\text{.}\)</span>  After a long time, the population vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_k\approx
c_1(1.6)^k\vvec_2\)</span> so both populations grow by a factor of 1.6 and with a ratio <span class="process-math">\(R_k/S_k=1/3.\)</span></p>

<li>
<p>Here we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{3}
R_{k+1} \amp {}={} \amp 0.7R_k \amp{}+{} \amp 0.5S_k\\

<p class="continuation">Species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> helps species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to grow, while species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> inhibits the growth of species <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> One explanation for this is that species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> preys on species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> as a food source.</p>
<p>We have eigenvectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1=\twovec11\)</span> with associated eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=1.2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2=\twovec{5}{4}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=1.1\text{.}\)</span>  This dynamical system is a repellor so both species will grow arbitrarily large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This example is similar to the previous one, but the coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth rate of both species is smaller.  For instance, in the previous problem, we had <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=0.7R_k+\ldots\)</span> while we now have <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=0.5R_k+\ldots\text{.}\)</span>  This says that the reproduction rate of species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> has decreased from <span class="process-math">\(0.7\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(0.5\text{.}\)</span>  In the same way, that of species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> has decreased from <span class="process-math">\(1.6\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1.1\text{.}\)</span>  Also, <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=\ldots + 0.2S_k\)</span> so the presence of species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is less beneficial to species <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We now have the eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=0.9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=0.7\text{,}\)</span> which means that this dynamical system is an attractor and that both species will become extinct.</p>
