<p>In this activity, we seek to describe various matrix transformations by finding the matrix that gives the desired transformation.  All of the transformations that we study here have the form \(T:\real^2\to\real^2\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the matrix of the transformation that has no effect on vectors;  that is, \(T(\xvec) = \xvec\text{.}\)  We call this matrix the <em class="emphasis">identity</em> and denote it by \(I\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Find the matrix of the transformation that reflects vectors in \(\real^2\) over the line \(y=x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the result of composing the reflection you found in the previous part with itself;  that is, what is the effect of reflecting in the line \(y=x\) and then reflecting in this line again.  Provide a geometric explanation for your result as well as an algebraic one obtained by multiplying matrices.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the matrix that rotates vectors counterclockwise in the plane by \(90^\circ\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the result of rotating by \(90^\circ\) and then reflecting in the line \(y=x\) to the result of first reflecting in \(y=x\) and then rotating \(90^\circ\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Find the matrix that results from composing a \(90^\circ\) rotation with itself.  Explain the geometric meaning of this operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the matrix that results from composing a \(90^\circ\) rotation with itself four times; that is, if \(T\) is the matrix transformation that rotates vectors by \(90^\circ\text{,}\) find the matrix for \(T\circ T\circ T \circ
T\text{.}\)  Explain why your result makes sense geometrically.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Explain why the matrix that rotates vectors counterclockwise by an angle \(\theta\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
\cos\theta \amp -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta \amp \cos\theta \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
