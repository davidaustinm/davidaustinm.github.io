<p>If we consider the first column of \(A\text{,}\) we see that the entries represent the percentages of party \(P\)'s voters in the last election who vote for each of the three parties in the next election.  Since everyone who voted for party \(P\) previously votes for one of the three parties in the next election, the sum of these percentages must be 1.  This is true for each of the columns of \(A\text{,}\) which explains why \(A\) is a stochastic matrix.</p>
