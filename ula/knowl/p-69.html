<li><p>Yes, it is possible if the two planes are parallel to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>No, this is not possible.  Two planes will either intersect in a line, if they are not parallel, or not intersect at all, if they are parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, it is possible that four planes intersect in a line.  One may sketch four planes that intersect in, say, the \(z\)-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, we would expect there to be no solutions to four equations in three unknowns because there are more equations than unknowns.</p></li>
<li><p>Since there are more equations than unknowns, we would expect there to be no solutions.  We cannot guarantee this, however.</p></li>
<li><p>Since there are fewer equations than unknowns, we would expect there to be infinitely many solutions.  We cannot guarantee this, however.</p></li>
