<p>Now that we are interested in solving equations of the form \(A\xvec = \bvec\text{,}\) we might try to find a similar approach. Is there a matrix \(A^{-1}\) that plays the role of the multiplicative inverse?  Of course, we can't expect every matrix to have a multiplicative inverse; after all, the real number \(0\) doesn't have an inverse.  We will see, however, that many matrices do.</p>
