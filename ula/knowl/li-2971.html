<p>When \(p=0\text{,}\) we have a saddle.  Notice that \(R\) will go extinct if the initial population of \(R\) is zero.  As we increase \(p\text{,}\) we still have a saddle, but \(R\) will now go extinct when the initial \(S\) population is positive.  Eventually, when \(p=1\text{,}\) we see that \(R\) will go extinct as long as \(R_0\gt S_0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>As we increase the predation rate, the population of \(S\) is lowered by \(R\text{.}\)  However, \(S\) is necessary to \(R\)'s survival.  When the predation rate grows too large, there needs to be a sufficiently large initial \(S\) population to support both species.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dynamical.html#li-2971">in-context</a></span>
