<li><p>Since a typical computer has 15 or more decimal places of accuracy, the error in each individual calculation is relatively small.  However, if we are working with a large matrix, we are performing many calculations and the errors from each of them may accumulate to become significant.</p></li>
<li><p>If we need to solve \(A\xvec=\bvec\) for a couple of different vectors \(\bvec\text{,}\) we do not have to perform Gaussian elimination again.  Some other quantities, like the inverse and determinant of \(A\text{,}\) are more easily computed using an \(LU\) factorization.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix \(A\) is invertible if and only if \(U\) is, and we can easily see if \(U\) is invertible by noting if every row has a pivot.</p></li>
