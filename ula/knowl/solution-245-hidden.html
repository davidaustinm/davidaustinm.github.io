<li>
<p>Notice that page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> receives half of the PageRank from pages <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span>  This means that <span class="process-math">\(x_2=\frac12x_2+\frac12x_3\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Also, page <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> receives half of the PageRank from page <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and none from page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> so we have <span class="process-math">\(x_3=\frac12 x_1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
x_1 \amp {}={} \amp \amp \amp x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp
\frac12x_3 \\
x_2 \amp {}={} \amp \frac12x_1\amp \amp \amp {}+{} \amp
\frac12x_3 \\
x_3 \amp {}={} \amp \frac12x_1\amp \amp \amp \amp\text{.} \\
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>From the equations, we see that <span class="process-math">\(G=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 1 \amp \frac12 \\
\frac12 \amp 0 \amp \frac12 \\
\frac12 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>All of the entries of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> are nonnegative and the columns each add to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>  This tells us that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is stochastic.</p></li>
<li><p>We see that <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=1\)</span> is an eigenvalue and that the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_1\)</span> is spanned by <span class="process-math">\(\threevec432\text{.}\)</span>  The unique steady-state vector is then <span class="process-math">\(\qvec=\threevec{\frac49}{\frac39}{\frac29}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Page <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is assessed to have the highest quality because its PageRank <span class="process-math">\(x_1=\frac49\)</span> is the largest.  This makes sense as a reflection of the structure of this Internet.  Since Page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> only links to Page <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and not Page <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> it is not as useful as Page <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>  Furthermore, Page <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> only has one incoming link so it is not viewed by Page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> as being useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Since all the entries of <span class="process-math">\(G^4\)</span> are positive, we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a positive matrix.  The Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us there is a unique steady-state vector, which we have already seen, and that any Markov chain will converge to it.</p></li>
<li><p>We verify that the Markov chain converges to the unique steady-state vector <span class="process-math">\(\qvec=\threevec{\frac49}{\frac39}{\frac29}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
