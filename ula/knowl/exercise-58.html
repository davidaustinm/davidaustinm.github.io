<p>When we explored matrix multiplication in <a href="sec-matrices-lin-combs.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.2: Matrix multiplication and linear combinations">SectionÂ 2.2</a>, we saw that some properties that are true for real numbers are not true for matrices.  This exercise will investigate that in some more depth.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that \(A\) and \(B\) are two matrices and that \(AB = 0\text{.}\)  If \(B \neq 0\text{,}\) what can you say about the linear independence of the columns of \(A\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that we have matrices \(A\text{,}\) \(B\) and \(C\) such that \(AB = AC\text{.}\)  We have seen that we cannot generally conclude that \(B=C\text{.}\)  If we assume additionally that \(A\) is a matrix whose columns are linearly independent, explain why \(B = C\text{.}\)  You may wish to begin by rewriting the equation \(AB = AC\) as \(AB-AC = A(B-C) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
