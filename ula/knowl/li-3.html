<p><em class="emphasis">Each section begins with a preview activity and includes a number of activities that can be used to facilitate active learning in a classroom.</em> By now, active learning's effectiveness in helping students develop a deep understanding of important mathematical concepts is beyond dispute.  The activities here are designed to reinforce ideas already encountered, motivate the need for upcoming ideas, and help students recognize various manifestations of simple underlying themes.  As much as possible, students are asked to develop new ideas and take ownership of them.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#li-3">in-context</a></span>
