<p>The identity matrix will play an important role at various points in our explorations.  It is important to note that it is a square matrix, meaning it has an equal number of rows and columns, so any matrix added to it must be square as well. Though we wrote it as \(I_n\) in the activity, we will often just write \(I\) when the dimensions are clear.</p>
