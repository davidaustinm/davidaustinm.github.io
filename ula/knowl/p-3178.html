<li><p>The determinant is <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> because the vectors are negatively oriented and the rectangle has sides of length <span class="process-math">\(\frac12\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> The determinant of a diagonal matrix seems to be the product of the diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix transformation is a reflection over the line <span class="process-math">\(y=x\)</span> and we see that the determinant is <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The determinant will continue to be <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> for any value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span>  This illustrates the fact that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The same reasoning tells us that this determinant is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and, in fact, the determinant of a lower triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The determinant of this matrix is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> because the parallelogram formed by the vector has no area.  This suggests that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are linearly dependent is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We find that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A) = -4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\det(B) = 2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\det(AB) = -8\text{.}\)</span>  This suggests that <span class="process-math">\(\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
