<p>In this activity, we will consider several ways in which two species might interact with one another.  Throughout, we will consider two species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> whose populations in year <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> form a vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_k=\twovec{R_k}{S_k}\)</span> and which evolve according to the rule</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<li>
<p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.7 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 1.6 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Explain why the species do not interact with one another.  Which of the six types of dynamical systems do we have?  What happens to both species after a long time?</p>

<p>Suppose now that <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}

<p>Explain why <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a beneficial species for <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Which of the six types of dynamical systems do we have?  What happens to both species after a long time?</p>

<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}

<li><p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.5 \amp 0.2 \\
-0.4 \amp 1.1 \\

\text{.}\)</span> Compare this predator-prey system to the one in the previous part.  Which of the six types of dynamical systems do we have?  What happens to both species after a long time?</p></li>
