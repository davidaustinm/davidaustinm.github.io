<p>We returned to Gaussian elimination, which we have used as a primary tool for finding solutions to linear systems, and explored its practicality as a computation tool, both in terms of numerical accuracy and computational effort.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We saw that the accuracy of computations implemented on a computer could be improved using <em class="emphasis">partial pivoting</em>, a technique that performs row interchanges so that the entry in a pivot position has the largest possible magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Beginning with a matrix \(A\text{,}\) we used the Gaussian elimination algorithm to write \(PA = LU\text{,}\) where \(P\) is a permutation matrix, \(L\) is lower triangular, and \(U\) is upper triangular.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding this factorization involves roughly as much work as performing Gaussian elimination.  However, once we have the factorization, we are able to quickly solve equations of the form \(A\xvec = \bvec\) by first solving \(L\cvec =
P\bvec\) and then \(U\xvec = \cvec\text{.}\)</p></li>
