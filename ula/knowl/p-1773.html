<p>We will use the vector \(\xvec=\twovec{P}{Q}\) to represent the number of trucks at location \(P\) and \(Q\) in the morning.  We consider the matrix transformation \(T(\xvec) = \twovec{P'}{Q'}\) that describes the number of trucks at location \(P\) and \(Q\) in the evening. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-68"><script type="text/x-sage">

<p>Suppose that all 1000 trucks begin the day at location \(P\) and none at \(Q\text{.}\)  How many trucks are at each location at the end of the day? Therefore, what is the vector \(T\left(\ctwovec{1000}{0}\right)\text{?}\)</p>
<p>Using this result, what is \(T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right)\text{?}\)</p>

<li><p>In the same way, suppose that all 1000 trucks begin the day at location \(Q\) and none at \(P\text{.}\)  How many trucks are at each location at the end of the day? What is the result \(T\left(\ctwovec{0}{1000}\right)\text{?}\)</p></li>
