<li><p>This is a unanimous decision.</p></li>
<li><p>The unanimous decision is essentially represented as <span class="process-math">\(-\uvec_1\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> represents a unanimous decision.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a 5-4 decision with the 5 conservative justices voting in the majority.</p></li>
<li><p>This 5-4 decision is essentially represented as <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_2\text{,}\)</span> the second most important left singular vector.</p></li>
<li><p>We see that the most decisions are unanimous, which is why <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> represents unanimous decisions. The second most frequently occurring decisions is a 5-4 decision, which is why <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_2\)</span> represents a 5-4 decision that leans to the conservative justices.</p></li>
<li><p>The first singular vector <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> represents a case where the five conservative justices are voting together.  From this we conclude that the court leans toward the conservatives.</p></li>
<li><p>The second left singular vector <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_2\)</span> essentially records the vote of Sandra Day O'Connor and shows how her vote has the power to swing a 5-4 decision from a conservative majority to a progressive majority.</p></li>
<li><p>Sandra Day O'Connor would be the swing vote.</p></li>
