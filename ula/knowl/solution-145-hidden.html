<li><p>The determinant is \(-1\) because the vectors are negatively oriented and the rectangle has sides of length \(\frac12\) and \(2\text{.}\)  The matrix transformation scales vectors by \(-\frac12\) in the horizontal direction and \(2\) in the vertical direction.  We are led to believe that the determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix transformation is a reflection over the line \(y=x\) and we see that the determinant is \(-1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix transformation represents a horizontal shear, and the determinant is \(2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The determinant will continue to be \(2\) for any value of \(k\text{.}\)  This illustrates the fact that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The same reasoning tells us that this determinant is \(2\) and, in fact, the determinant of a lower triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>The determinant of this matrix is \(0\) because the parallelogram formed by the vector has no area.  The matrix transformation smashes the plane down onto the line \(y=2x\text{.}\)  This suggests that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are linearly dependent is \(0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We find that \(\det A = -4\text{,}\) \(\det B = 2\text{,}\) and \(\det(AB) = -8\text{.}\)  This suggests that \(\det(AB) = \det A \det B\text{.}\)</p></li>
