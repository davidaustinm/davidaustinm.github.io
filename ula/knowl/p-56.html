<p>It seems reasonable to wonder if the number of solutions depends on whether the number of equations is less than, equal to, or greater than the number of unknowns.  Of course, this cannot always be the case;  remember that one of our examples consisted of two equations that were graphically represented by parallel lines and that therefore had no solutions.  Still, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.</p>
