<p>Chemists denote a molecule of water as \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\text{,}\) which means it is composed of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O). The process by which hydrogen is burned is described by the chemical reaction</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x\thinspace \text{H}_2 + y\thinspace\text{O}_2 \to
z\thinspace \text{H}_2\text{O}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This means that \(x\) molecules of hydrogen \(\text{H}_2\) combine with \(y\) molecules of oxygen \(\text{O}_2\) to produce \(z\) water molecules. The number of hydrogen atoms is the same before and after the reaction;  the same is true of the oxygen atoms.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>How many hydrogen atoms are there before the reaction?  How many hydrogen atoms are there after the reaction?  Find a linear equation in \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) by equating these quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a second linear equation in \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) by equating the number of oxygen atoms before and after the reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the solutions of this linear system. Why are there infinitely many solutions? <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-18"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p></li>
<li><p>In this chemical setting, \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) should be positive integers.  Find the solution where \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) are the smallest possible positive integers.</p></li>
