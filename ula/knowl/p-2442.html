<li><p>The matrix \(\left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1 \amp
\vvec_2 \end{array}\right]\) is row equivalent to the identity matrix so it has a pivot position in every row. The columns therefore span \(\real^2\text{.}\)  There is also a pivot position in every column, which means that the columns are linearly independent.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We note that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp -1 \amp -1
\end{array}\right]
\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1
\end{array}\right]\text{.}

<p>Since there is a pivot position in every row, the vectors span \(\real^3\text{.}\)  Since there is a pivot position in every column, the vectors are linearly independent. Consequently, this set of vectors forms a basis for \(\real^3\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The matrix whose columns are the vectors \(\vvec_1\text{,}\) \(\vvec_2\text{,}\) \(\vvec_3\text{,}\) and \(\vvec_4\) has dimensions \(3\times4\text{.}\) Therefore, there cannot be a pivot position in every column, which tells us that the columns cannot be linearly independent.  Therefore, the set of vectors do not form a basis for \(\real^3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Putting these vectors into a matrix produces the identity matrix, which has a pivot position in every row and every column.  Therefore, the vectors span \(\real^3\) and are linearly independent.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be a pivot position in every row and every column.</p></li>
<li><p>A basis for \(\real^{10}\) must have \(10\) vectors.  Because the associated matrix must have a pivot position in every row and every column, there must be the same number of columns as there are rows.  Since the vectors are \(10\)-dimensional, there must be 10 vectors.</p></li>
