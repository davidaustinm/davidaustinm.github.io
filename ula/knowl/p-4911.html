<p>Our discussion so far has ignored one issue, however. Remember that we sometimes have to perform row interchange operations in addition to row replacement.  A typical row interchange is represented by multiplication by a matrix such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which has the effect of interchanging the first and third rows. Notice that this matrix is not triangular so performing a row interchange will ruin the \(LU\) factorization we seek.  We will not give the details here, but linear algebra software packages provide a matrix \(P\) that describes how the rows are permuted in the Gaussian elimination process.  In particular, we will write \(PA = LU\text{,}\) where \(P\) is a permutation matrix, \(L\) is lower triangular, and \(U\) is upper triangular.</p>
