<p>The matrix \(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 \amp 1 \\
1 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\) is not positive.  We can see this because some of the entries of \(A\) are zero and therefore not positive.  In addition, we see that \(A^2 = I\text{,}\) \(A^3 = A\) and so forth.  Therefore, every power of \(A\) also has some zero entries, which means that \(A\) is not positive.</p>
<p>The matrix \(B = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.4 \amp 0.3 \\
0.6 \amp 0.7 \\
\end{array}\right]\) is positive because every entry of \(B\) is positive.</p>
<p>Also, the matrix \(C = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 \amp 0.5 \\
1 \amp 0.5 \\
\end{array}\right]\) clearly has a zero entry.  However, \(C^2 = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.5 \amp 0.25 \\
0.5 \amp 0.75 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{,}\) which has all positive entries.  Therefore, we see that \(C\) is a positive matrix.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-stochastic.html#example-28">in-context</a></span>
