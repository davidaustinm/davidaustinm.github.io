<p>In the first approximation, the reconstructed vector \(\yvec\) agrees with the original vector \(\xvec\text{.}\)  In the second approximation, there are only two nonzero Fourier coefficients, and we see that the approximating vector differs from the original vector.  In the second case, however, we are using only one quarter of the Fourier coefficients.  Though the entries in the vector \(\yvec\) differ from those in the original vector \(\xvec\text{,}\) the difference is probably not visually noticeable since the possible values range from 0 to 255.</p>
