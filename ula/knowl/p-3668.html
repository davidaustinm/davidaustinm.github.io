<p>We saw in the last chapter, however, that some problems become simpler when we look at them in a new basis.  Is it possible that questions about the non-diagonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> become simpler when viewed in a different basis?  We will see that the answer is "yes," and see how the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which will be developed in this chapter, provides the key.  We will see how this theory provides an appropriate change of basis so that questions about the non-diagonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are equivalent to questions about the diagonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  In fact, we will see that these two matrices are, in some sense, equivalent to one another.</p>
