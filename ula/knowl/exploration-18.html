<p>Suppose that our rental car company rents from two locations \(P\) and \(Q\text{.}\)  We find that 80% of the cars rented from location \(P\) are returned to \(P\) while the other 20% are returned to \(Q\text{.}\)  For cars rented from location \(Q\text{,}\) 60% are returned to \(Q\) and 40% to \(P\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We will use \(P_k\) and \(Q_k\) to denote the number of cars at the two locations on day \(k\text{.}\)  The following day, the number of cars at \(P\) equals 80% of \(P_k\) and 40% of \(Q_k\text{.}\)  This shows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
P_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.8 P_k + 0.4Q_k \\
Q_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.2 P_k + 0.6Q_k\text{.} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

<li><p>If we use the vector \(\xvec_k =
\twovec{P_k}{Q_k}\) to represent the distribution of cars on day \(k\text{,}\) find a matrix \(A\) such that \(\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k\text{.}\)</p></li>
