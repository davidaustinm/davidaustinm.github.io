<p>A degree three polynomial can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) and \(d\) are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point \((3,1)\text{,}\) we should require that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(3) = a + 3b + 9c + 27d = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) and \(d\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write the four linear equations for the coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the polynomial \(p(x)\) passes through the four points above.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the augmented matrix corresponding to this system of equations and use the Sage cell below to solve for the coefficients. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-24"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p></li>
<li><p>Write the polynomial \(p(x)\) that you found and check your work by graphing it in the Sage cell below and verifying that it passes through the four points.  To plot a function over a range, you may use a command like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore"> plot(1 + x- 2*x^2, xmin = -1, xmax = 4)</code>. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-25"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p></li>
<li>
<p>Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose we wanted to find a polynomial that passes through the four points and that has degree two, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solve the system of equations for the coefficients. What can you say about the existence and uniqueness of a degree two polynomial passing through these four points? <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-26"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></div></p>

<li>
<p>Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose we wanted to find a polynomial that passes through the four points and that has degree four, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4\text{.}

<li><p>Suppose you had 10 points and you wanted to find a polynomial passing through each of them.  What should the degree of the polynomial be to guarantee that there is exactly one such polynomial?  Explain your response.</p></li>
