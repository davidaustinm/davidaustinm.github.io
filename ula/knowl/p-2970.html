<p>We saw that the determinant of a product of matrices equals the product of the determinants; that is, \(\det AB =
\det A \det B\text{.}\)  Thus far, we have been thinking of the determinant as the area of a parallelogram.  We may also think of it as a factor by which areas are scaled under the matrix transformation defined by the matrix.  As seen in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-det-multiplies.html" title="Figure 3.4.7">FigureÂ 3.4.7</a>, applying the transform \(B\) scales the area by a factor of \(\det B\text{.}\)  Next applying the transform \(A\) scales the area by a factor of \(\det
A\text{.}\)  The total scaling is then \(\det A\det B\text{.}\)</p>
