<p>Solutions to the first three parts of this activity are presented below.  It is also important to consider the fourth and fifth parts.</p>
<p>No matter the value of \(x\text{,}\) we have \(0x = 0\text{.}\) Therefore, the solution space to the equation \(0x=0\) is all real numbers \(x\text{.}\)  In other words, this equation does not place a restriction on the value of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>By contrast, the equation \(0x=5\) has no solutions since no value of \(x\text{,}\) when multiplied by \(0\text{,}\) can produce \(5\text{.}\)</p>
