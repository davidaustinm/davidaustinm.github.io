<p>The cofactor expansion method will be useful to us in the next chapter when we look at eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  It is not, however, a practical way to compute a determinant.  To see why, consider the fact that the determinant of a \(2\times2\) matrix, written as \(ad-bc\text{,}\) requires us to compute two terms, \(ad\) and \(bc\text{.}\)  To compute the determinant of a \(3\times3\) matrix, we need to compute three \(2\times2\) determinants, which involves \(3\cdot 2 = 6\) terms.  For a \(4\times4\) matrix, we need to compute four \(3\times3\) determinants, which produces \(4\cdot3\cdot2 = 24\) terms.  Continuing in this way, we see that the cofactor expansion of a \(10\times10\) matrix would involve \(10\cdot9\cdot8\ldots3\cdot2 = 10! = 3628800\) terms. By coincidence, this is exactly the number of seconds in six weeks.</p>
