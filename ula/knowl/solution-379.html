<li><p><span class="process-math">\(q_D(\xvec) = 3x_1^2 - x_2^2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(q_D\left(\twovec10\right) = 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_D\left(\twovec01\right) = -1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We have <span class="process-math">\(q_D(\uvec) = 3u_1^2 - u_2^2 = 3 -
4u_2^2\)</span> so that the quadratic form only depends on <span class="process-math">\(u_2\text{.}\)</span>  The graph of this function of <span class="process-math">\(u_2\)</span> is a parabola that has a maximum of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(u_2=0\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(u_1^2 = 1-u_2^2\text{,}\)</span> this means that the maximum occurs when <span class="process-math">\(u_1=\pm 1\text{.}\)</span> We therefore see that the maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(q_D(\uvec)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> in the direction <span class="process-math">\(\twovec10\)</span> as we saw from the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Now <span class="process-math">\(q_D(\uvec) = -1 + 4u_1^2\text{,}\)</span> which has a minimum value of <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(u_1=0\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the minimum value of <span class="process-math">\(q_D(\uvec)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> in the direction <span class="process-math">\(\twovec01\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The graph of <span class="process-math">\(q_A\)</span> appears to be similar to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(q_D\)</span> only rotated by <span class="process-math">\(45^\circ\text{.}\)</span> This means the maximum appears to occur in the direction <span class="process-math">\(\twovec11\)</span> and the minimum in the direction <span class="process-math">\(\twovec{-1}1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is orthogonal, we have <span class="process-math">\(QQ^T=I\)</span> so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}

<li>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(q_A(\uvec) = q_D(\vvec)\text{,}\)</span> the maximum of <span class="process-math">\(q_A(\uvec)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> which occurs when <span class="process-math">\(\vvec = Q^T\uvec = \twovec10\text{.}\)</span>  This means that <span class="process-math">\(\uvec=Q\twovec10 =

<p>In the same way, the minimum value of <span class="process-math">\(q_A(\uvec)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> which occurs when <span class="process-math">\(\uvec=\twovec{1/\sqrt{2}}{1/\sqrt{2}}\text{,}\)</span> the eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> associated to <span class="process-math">\(\lambda=-1\text{.}\)</span></p>
