<p>Linear algebra owes its prominence as a powerful scientific tool to the ever-growing power of computers.  Carl Cowen, a former president of the Mathematical Association of America, has said, “No serious application of linear algebra happens without a computer.” Indeed, Cowen notes that, in the 1950s, working with a system of 100 equations in 100 variables was difficult. Today, scientists and mathematicians routinely work on problems that are vastly larger.  This is only possible because of today's computing power.</p>
