<p>Suppose that a bicycle sharing program has two locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  Bicycles are rented from some location in the morning and returned to a location in the evening.  Suppose that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>60% of bicycles that begin at <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in the morning are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in the evening while the other 40% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>30% of bicycles that begin at <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and the other 70% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
