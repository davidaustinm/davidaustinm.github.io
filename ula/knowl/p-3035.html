<p>In this section, we associated a numerical quantity, the determinant, to a square matrix and showed that it tells us whether the matrix is invertible.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The determinant of an \(n\times n\) matrix may be thought of as measuring the size of the box formed by the column vectors together with a sign measuring their orientation.  When \(n=2\text{,}\) for example, the determinant is the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two columns of the matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>We saw that the determinant satisfied many properties. Most importantly, we saw that \(\det AB = \det A \det B\) and that the determinant of a triangular matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>These properties helped us compute the determinant of a matrix using row operations.  This also led to the important observation that the determinant of a matrix is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we learned how to compute the determinant of a matrix using cofactor expansions.  Though this is an inefficient method for computing determinants, it will be a valuable tool for us in the next chapter.</p></li>
