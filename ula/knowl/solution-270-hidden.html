<li><p>We see that the vectors \(\overline{\xvec}_k\) do not converge but instead flip between approximations to \(\vvec_2\) and \(-\vvec_2\text{.}\) Also, the multipliers \(m_k\) are converging to \(1\) rather than \(-1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>When applying the power method, the multipliers \(m_k\) are usually formed from the same component of the vectors \(\overline{\xvec}_k\) in every iteration.  Here, we see that the multipliers are obtained from the first component, then the second component, then the first, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose one of the components, say, the first one and consider the ratio between that component of \(A\overline{\xvec}_k\) and \(\overline{\xvec}_k\) in place of the multiplier \(m_k\text{.}\)  The problem is that you must make sure that this component is not approaching zero.</p></li>
