<p>A degree three polynomial can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point <span class="process-math">\((3,1)\text{,}\)</span> we should require that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}

<li><p>Write the four linear equations for the coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> passes through the four points above.</p></li>
