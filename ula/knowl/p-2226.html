<p>This activity demonstrates a few important things.  First, we said that \(A\) is invertible if there is a matrix \(B\) such that \(BA = I\text{.}\)  In general, multiplying matrices requires care because the product depends on the order in which the matrices are multiplied.  However, in this case, we can check that \(BA = I\) implies that \(AB = I\) as well.  This means that \(B\) is also invertible and that \(A=B^{-1}\text{.}\) This is the subject of <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex-right-inverse.html" title="Exercise 3.1.5.9">ExerciseÂ 3.1.5.9</a>.</p>
