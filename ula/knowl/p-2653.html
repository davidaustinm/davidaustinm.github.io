<li><p>The matrix <span class="process-math">\(\left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1 \amp

<p class="continuation">Since there is a pivot position in every row, the span of the vectors is <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\text{.}\)</span>  Since there is a pivot position in every column, the vectors are linearly independent.  Consequently, this set of vectors forms a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>The matrix whose columns are the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_4\)</span> has dimensions <span class="process-math">\(3\times4\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, there cannot be a pivot position in every column, which tells us that the columns cannot be linearly independent.  Therefore, the set of vectors do not form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Putting these vectors into a matrix produces the identity matrix, which has a pivot position in every row and every column.  Therefore, the span of the vectors is <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\text{,}\)</span> and they are linearly independent.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be a pivot position in every row and every column.</p></li>
<li><p>A basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^{10}\)</span> must have <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> vectors.  Because the associated matrix must have a pivot position in every row and every column, there must be the same number of columns as there are rows.  Since the vectors are <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span>-dimensional, there must be 10 vectors.</p></li>
