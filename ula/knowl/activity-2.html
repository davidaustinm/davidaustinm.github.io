<p>This activity begins with equations having three unknowns. In this case, we know that the solutions of a single equation form a plane.  If it helps with visualization, consider using \(3\times5\) inch index cards to represent planes.</p>

<li><p>Is it possible that there are no solutions to two linear equations in three unknowns?  Either sketch an example or give a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that there is exactly one solution to two linear equations in three unknowns?  Either sketch an example or give a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that the solutions to four equations in three unknowns form a line?  Either sketch an example or give a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>What would you usually expect for the set of solutions to four equations in three unknowns?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose we have 500 linear equations in 10 unknowns.  What would be a reasonable guess for which of the three possibilities for the set of solutions holds?</p></li>
