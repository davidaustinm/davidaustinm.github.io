<li><p>False.  We only know that one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.</p></li>
<li><p>True.  If we put the vectors into a matrix, there are more columns than rows.  Therefore, there must be a column without a pivot position so the vectors form a linearly dependent set.</p></li>
<li><p>False.  They could form a linearly independent set, but we cannot guarantee it.  We would have to look at the location of the pivot positions in the associated <span class="process-math">\(10\times5\)</span> matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>True.  In this case, <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_2\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors so the set is linearly dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>True.  Since the vectors are linearly independent, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a pivot position in every column.  Therefore, there is not a free variable in the description of the solution space to the equation <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec=\bvec\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the solution is unique.</p></li>
