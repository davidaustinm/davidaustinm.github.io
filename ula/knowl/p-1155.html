<p>Suppose that a city is starting a bicycle sharing program with bicycles at locations \(B\) and \(C\text{.}\)  Bicycles that are rented at one location may be returned to either location at the end of the day.  Over time, the city finds that 80% of bicycles rented at location \(B\) are returned to \(B\) with the other 20% returned to \(C\text{.}\)  Similarly, 50% of bicycles rented at location \(C\) are returned to \(B\) and 50% to \(C\text{.}\)</p>
