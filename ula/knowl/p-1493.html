<p>By now, it shouldn't be too surprising that the pivot positions play an important role in determining whether the columns of a matrix are linearly dependent.  Let's discuss the previous activity to make this clear.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Let's consider the first example from the activity in which we have vectors in \(\real^4\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
\vvec_1 \amp 	  \vvec_2 \amp 	  \vvec_3 \amp
\vvec_4 \amp	  \vvec_5 
\end{array}\right]
\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that the third column does not contain a pivot position. Let's focus on the first three columns and consider them as an augmented matrix:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
\vvec_1 \amp 	  \vvec_2 \amp 	  \vvec_3 
\end{array}\right]
\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>There is not a pivot in the rightmost column so we know that \(\vvec_3\) can be written as a linear combination of \(\vvec_1\) and \(\vvec_2\text{.}\)  In fact, we can read the weights from the augmented matrix:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vvec_3 = -\vvec_1 + 2\vvec_2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This says that the set of vectors \(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5\) is linearly dependent.</p>
<p>This points to the general observation that a set of vectors is linearly dependent if the matrix they form has a column without a pivot.</p>
<p>In addition, the fifth column of this matrix does not contain a pivot meaning that \(\vvec_5\) can be written as a linear combination:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vvec_5 = 2\vvec_1 + 3\vvec_2 -\vvec_4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This example shows that vectors in columns that do not contain a pivot may be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in columns that do contain pivots.  In this case, we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\span{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3,\vvec_4,\vvec_5}
=\span{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, the second set of vectors we studied produces a matrix with a pivot in every column.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
\wvec_1 \amp 	  \wvec_2 \amp 	  \wvec_3 \\
\end{array}\right]
\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If we interpret this as an augmented matrix again, we see that the linear system is inconsistent since there is a pivot in the rightmost column.  This means that \(\wvec_3\) cannot be expressed as a linear combination of \(\wvec_1\) and \(\wvec_2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Similarly, \(\wvec_2\) cannot be expressed as a linear combination of \(\wvec_1\text{.}\) In addition, if \(\wvec_2\) could be expressed as a linear combination of \(\wvec_1\) and \(\wvec_3\text{,}\) we could rearrange that expression to write \(\wvec_3\) as a linear combination of \(\wvec_1\) and \(\wvec_2\text{,}\) which we know is impossible.</p>
<p>We can therefore conclude that \(\wvec_1\text{,}\) \(\wvec_2\text{,}\) and \(\wvec_3\) form a linearly indpendent set of vectors.</p>
