<p>In a sense that will be made precise later, having a set of eigenvectors of \(A\) that forms a basis of \(\real^2\) enables us to think of \(A\) as being equivalent to a diagonal matrix \(D\text{.}\)  Of course, as the other examples in the previous activity show, it may not always be possible to form a basis from the eigenvectors of a matrix.  For example, the only eigenvectors of the matrix \(\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 2
\end{array}\right]\text{,}\) which represents a shear, have the form \(\twovec{x}{0}\text{.}\)  In this example, we are not able to create a basis for \(\real^2\) consisting of eigenvectors of the matrix.  This is also true for the matrix \(\left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 \amp -1 \\
1 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{,}\) which represents a \(90^\circ\) rotation.</p>
