<p>In fact, solving an equation with an \(n\times n\) triangular matrix requires approximately \(\frac 12 n^2\) operations.  Once we have the factorization \(A=LU\text{,}\) we solve the equation \(A\xvec=\bvec\) by solving two equations involving triangular matrices, which requires about \(n^2\) operations.  For example, if \(A\) is a \(1000\times1000\) matrix, we solve the equation \(A\xvec = \bvec\) using about one million steps.  The compares with the third of a billion operations we need to perform Gaussian elimination.  That represents a significant savings.  Of course, we have to first find the \(LU\) factorization of \(A\) and this requires roughly the same amount of work as performing Gaussian elimination.  However, once we have the \(LU\) factorization, we can use it to solve \(A\xvec=\bvec\) for different right hand sides \(\bvec\text{.}\)</p>
