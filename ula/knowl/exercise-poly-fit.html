<p>In a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a unique line passing through both of them.  In this problem, we will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown on the right. <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:2.5%;margin-right:2.5%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:47.3684210526316%;"><img src="external/images/interpolation-0.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

</div></div></p>
<p>A degree three polynomial can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point <span class="process-math">\((3,1)\text{,}\)</span> we should require that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(3) = a + 3b + 9c + 27d = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write the four linear equations for the coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> passes through the four points above.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the augmented matrix corresponding to this system of equations and use the Sage cell below to solve for the coefficients. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-25"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></pre></p></li>
<li><p>Write the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> that you found and check your work by graphing it in the Sage cell below and verifying that it passes through the four points.  To plot a function over a range, you may use a command like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore"> plot(1 + x- 2*x^2, xmin = -1, xmax = 4)</code>. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-26"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></pre></p></li>
<li>
<p>Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose we wanted to find a polynomial that passes through the four points and that has degree two, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Solve the linear system for the coefficients. What can you say about the existence and uniqueness of a degree two polynomial passing through these four points? <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-27"><script type="text/x-sage">

</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose we wanted to find a polynomial that passes through the four points and that has degree four, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4\text{.}

</li>
<li><p>Suppose you had 10 points and you wanted to find a polynomial passing through each of them.  What should the degree of the polynomial be to guarantee that there is exactly one such polynomial?  Explain your response.</p></li>
