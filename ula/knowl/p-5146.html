<p>In fact, solving an equation with an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> triangular matrix requires approximately <span class="process-math">\(\frac 12 n^2\)</span> operations. Once we have the factorization <span class="process-math">\(A=LU\text{,}\)</span> we solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec=\bvec\)</span> by solving two equations involving triangular matrices, which requires about <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> operations. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(1000\times1000\)</span> matrix, we solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec = \bvec\)</span> using about one million steps.  The compares with roughly a billion operations needed to perform Gaussian elimination, which represents a significant savings.  Of course, we have to first find the <span class="process-math">\(LU\)</span> factorization of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and this requires roughly the same amount of work as performing Gaussian elimination. However, once we have the <span class="process-math">\(LU\)</span> factorization, we can use it to solve <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec=\bvec\)</span> for different right hand sides <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\text{.}\)</span></p>
