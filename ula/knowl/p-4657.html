<p>The ability to access almost anything we want to know through the Internet is something we take for granted in today's society. Without Google's PageRank algorithm, however, the Internet would be a chaotic place indeed; imagine trying to find a useful web page among the 30 trillion available pages without it.  (There are, of course, other search algorithms, but Google's is the most widely used.)  The fundamental role that Markov chains and the Perron-Frobenius theorem play in Google's algorithm demonstrates the vast power that mathematics has to shape our society.</p>
