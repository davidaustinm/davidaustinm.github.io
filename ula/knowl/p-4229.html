<p>If we know the populations in one year, they are determined in the following year by the expressions</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
R_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.9 R_k + 0.8 S_k \\
S_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.2 R_k + 0.9 S_k\text{.} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We will combine the populations in a vector \(\xvec_k = \twovec{R_k}{S_k}\) and note that \(\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k\) where \(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.9 \amp 0.8 \\
0.2 \amp 0.9 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Verify that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vvec_1=\twovec{2}{1},\qquad
\vvec_2=\twovec{-2}{1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>are eigenvectors of \(A\) and find their respective eigenvalues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suppose that initially \(\xvec_0 = \twovec{2}{3}\text{.}\) Write \(\xvec_0\) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors \(\vvec_1\) and \(\vvec_2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Write the vectors \(\xvec_1\text{,}\) \(\xvec_2\text{,}\) and \(\xvec_3\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors \(\vvec_1\) and \(\vvec_2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>When \(k\) becomes very large, what happens to the ratio of the populations \(R_k/S_k\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If we begin instead with \(\xvec_0 =
\twovec{4}{4}\text{,}\) what eventually happens to the ratio \(R_k/S_k\) as \(k\) becomes very large?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain what happens to the ratio \(R_k/S_k\) as \(k\) becomes very large no matter what the initial populations are.</p></li>
<li><p>After a very long time, by approximately what factor does the population of \(R\) grow every year?  By approximately what factor does the population of \(S\) grow every year?</p></li>
