<p>This example is similar to the previous one, but the coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth rate of both species is smaller.  For instance, in the previous problem, we had \(R_{k+1}=0.7R_k+\ldots\) while we now have \(R_{k+1}=0.5R_k+\ldots\text{.}\)  This says that the reproduction rate of species \(R\) has decreased from \(0.7\) to \(0.5\text{.}\)  In the same way, that of species \(S\) has decreased from \(1.6\) to \(1.1\text{.}\)  Also, \(R_{k+1}=\ldots + 0.2S_k\) so the presence of species \(S\) is less beneficial to species \(R\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We now have the eigenvalues \(\lambda_1=0.9\) and \(\lambda_2=0.7\text{,}\) which means that this dynamical system is an attractor and that both species will become extinct.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dynamical.html#li-2920">in-context</a></span>
