<li><p>If both \(A\) and \(B\) are stochastic, all the entries of both \(A\) and \(B\) are nonnegative. Therefore, the entries of \(AB\) are also nonnegative.  In addition, we have \(S(AB) = (SA)B = SB = S\text{,}\) which shows that \(AB\) is stochastic.</p></li>
<li><p>This follows from the previous part, which shows that the product of two stochastic matrices is stochastic.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If \(\qvec\) is a steady-state vector for \(A\text{,}\) it will be a steady-state vector for \(A^2\) as well because \(A^2\qvec = A\qvec=\qvec\text{.}\)</p>
<p>However, it is possible that there are steady-state vectors of \(A^2\) that are not steady-state vectors of \(A\text{.}\)  If the eigenvalues of \(A\) are \(\lambda_j\text{,}\) remember that the eigenvalues of \(A^2\) are \(\lambda_j^2\text{.}\)  Therefore, \(A^2\) can have more steady-state vectors if \(\lambda_j=-1\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\text{,}\) which leads to \(\lambda_j^2=1\text{.}\)  For instance, \(A=\mattwo0110\) has a unique steady-state vector \(\twovec{\frac12}{\frac12}\) whereas every probability vector \(\twovec{p}{1-p}\) is a steady-state vector for \(A^2=\mattwo1001\text{.}\)</p>
