<p>Suppose that we work for a company that makes baked goods, including cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs.  The company operates two bakeries, Bakery 1 and Bakery 2.  In one hour of operation,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Bakery 1 produces 10 cakes, 50 doughnuts, and 30 eclairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Bakery 2 produces 20 cakes, 30 doughnuts, and 30 eclairs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">If Bakery 1 operates for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> hours and Bakery 2 for <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> hours, we will use the vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec=\twovec{x_1}{x_2}\)</span> to describe the operation of the two bakeries.</p>
<p>We would like to describe a matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\xvec\)</span> describes the number of hours the bakeries operate and <span class="process-math">\(T(\xvec)\)</span> describes the total number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs produced.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(T(\xvec) = \threevec{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(y_1\)</span> is the number of cakes, <span class="process-math">\(y_2\)</span> is the number of doughnuts, and <span class="process-math">\(y_3\)</span> is the number of eclairs produced.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(T:\real^n\to\real^m\text{,}\)</span> what are the values of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and what is the shape of the associated matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can determine the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-linear-trans-columns.html" title="Proposition 2.5.6">PropositionÂ 2.5.6</a>.  For instance, <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\twovec10\right)\)</span> will describe the number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs produced when Bakery 1 operates for one hour and Bakery 2 sits idle.  What is this vector?</p></li>
<li><p>In the same way, determine <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\twovec01\right)\text{.}\)</span>  What is the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If Bakery 1 operates for 120 hours and Bakery 2 for 180 hours, what is the total number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs produced? <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-69"><script type="text/x-sage">

<li><p>Suppose that in one period of time, the company produces 5060 cakes, 14310 doughnuts, and 10470 eclairs.  How long did each bakery operate?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the company receives an order for a certain number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs.  Can you guarantee that you can fill the order without having leftovers?</p></li>
