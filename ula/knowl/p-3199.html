<p>In <a href="sec-matrix-inverse.html#subsec-triangular-invertible" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.1.3: Triangular matrices and Gaussian elimination">Subsection 3.1.3</a>, we saw how to describe the three row operations, scaling, interchange, and replacement, using matrix multiplication.  If we perform a row operation on the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to obtain the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A'\text{,}\)</span> we would like to relate <span class="process-math">\(\det(A)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\det(A')\text{.}\)</span>  To do so, remember that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Scalings are performed by multiplying a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by a diagonal matrix, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which has the effect of multiplying the second row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> to obtain <span class="process-math">\(A'\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is diagonal, we know that its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries so that <span class="process-math">\(\det(S) = 3\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(A'=SA\)</span> and therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\det(A')=\det(S)\det(A) = 3\det(A).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In general, if we scale a row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\det(A') =
k\det(A)\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interchanges are performed by matrices such as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/proposition-det-properties.html">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which has the effect of interchanging the first and second rows of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/proposition-det-properties.html" title="Proposition 3.4.8">Proposition 3.4.8</a>, <span class="process-math">\(\det(P) = -1\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, when <span class="process-math">\(PA=A'\text{,}\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/proposition-det-properties.html">
\begin{equation*}
\det(A')=\det(P)
\det(A) = -\det(A).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In other words, <span class="process-math">\(\det(A') =
-\det(A)\)</span> when we perform an interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Row replacement operations are performed by matrices such as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
R = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
-2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which multiplies the first row by <span class="process-math">\(-2\)</span> and adds the result to the third row.  Since this is a lower triangular matrix, we know that the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries, which says that <span class="process-math">\(\det(R) = 1\text{.}\)</span>  This means that when <span class="process-math">\(RA = A'\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\det(A')=\det(R)\det(A) = \det(A)\text{.}\)</span>  In other words, a row replacement does not change the determinant.</p>
