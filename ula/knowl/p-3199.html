<p>In the preview activity, we considered a \(3\times4\) matrix \(A\) and described two familiar sets of vectors. FIrst, we described the solution space to the homogeneous equation \(A\xvec = \zerovec\text{,}\) which is a set of vectors in \(\real^4\text{.}\)  Next, we described the span of the columns of \(A\text{,}\) which is a set of vectors in \(\real^3\text{.}\)  As we will see shortly, each of these sets has a common feature that we would like to study further: if we choose some vectors in one of these sets, any linear combination of those vectors is also in the set.  This observation motivates the following definition.</p>
