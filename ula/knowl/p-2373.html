<li><p>No.  If \(A\) has two identical columns, then the columns are not linearly independent.  This means there is a column without a pivot position and so \(A\) is not row equivalent to the identity matrix \(I\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>No.  If we perform a replacement operation that multiplies one of the equal rows by \(-1\) and adds it to the other equal row, we obtain a matrix having a row whose entries are all zero.  This says that the reduced row echelon form has such a row as well.  Therefore, there is a row that does not contain a pivot so the reduced row echelon form cannot be the identity \(I\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Yes.  If we multiply both sides of \(AB=AC\) by \(A^{-1}\) on the left, then we see that \(B=C\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The inverse \(A^{-1}\) is also invertible since \(A\) is its inverse.  Therefore, the span of the columns of \(A^{-1}\) is \(\real^n\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Yes.  Since \(A\) is row equivalent to the identity matrix \(I\text{,}\) the matrix \(B\) is as well.  Therefore, \(B\) is invertible.</p></li>
