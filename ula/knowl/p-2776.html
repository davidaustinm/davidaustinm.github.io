<p>On first glance, this probably looks intimidating, but we can make sense of it by looking at these vectors graphically.  Shown in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-jpeg-fourier-basis.html" title="Figure 3.3.7">FigureÂ 3.3.7</a> are four of these basis vectors.  Notice that \(\vvec_0\) is constantly 1, \(\vvec_1\) is relatively slowly varying, \(\vvec_2\) varies a little more rapidly, and \(\vvec_7\) varies quite rapidly. This is the main observation:  the basis vectors vary at different rates with the first vectors varying relatively slowly.</p>
