<p>It is a remarkable fact that algebra, which is about equations and their solutions, and geometry are intimately connected.  For instance, the solution set of a linear equation in two unknowns, such as \(2x + y = 1\text{,}\) can be represented graphically as a straight line.  The aim of this section is to further this connection by introducing vectors, which will help us to apply geometric intuition to our thinking about linear systems.</p>
