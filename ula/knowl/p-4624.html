<p>Page \(1\) is assessed to have the highest quality because its PageRank \(x_1=\frac49\) is the largest.  This makes sense as a reflection of the structure of this Internet.  Since Page \(2\) only links to Page \(1\) and not Page \(3\text{,}\) it is not as useful as Page \(1\text{.}\)  Furthermore, Page \(3\) only has one incoming link so it is not viewed by Page \(2\) as being useful.</p>
