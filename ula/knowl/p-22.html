<p>At its heart, the subject of linear algebra is about linear equations and, more specifically, sets of two or more linear equations.  Google routinely deals with a set of trillions of equations each of which has trillions of unknowns. We will eventually understand how to deal with that kind of complexity.  To begin, however, we will look at a more familiar situation in which there are a small number of equations and a small number of unknowns.  In spite of its relative simplicity, this situation is rich enough to demonstrate some fundamental concepts that will motivate much of our exploration.</p>
