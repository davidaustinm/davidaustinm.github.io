<p>As seen in an image, these blocks are relatively small, which means that the approximations we reconstruct are probably not noticeably different from the original.  Also, the blocks are small enough so that the image does not typically change a lot over the block.  At the same time, the blocks are large enough to allow us to save storage by throwing away some of the Fourier coefficients.</p>
