<p>This section has explored how appropriate changes in bases help us reconstruct an image using only a fraction of its data. This is known as image compression.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>There are several ways of representing colors, all of which use vectors in \(\real^3\text{.}\)  We explored the \(RGB\) color model, which is appropriate in digital applications, and the \(YC_bC_r\) model, in which the most important visual information is conveyed by the \(Y\) coordinate, known as lumninance.</p></li>
<li><p>We also explored a change of basis called the Discrete Fourier Transform.  In the coordinate system that results, the first coordinate measures the average of the components of a vector.  Subsequent components measure deviations from the average.</p></li>
<li><p>We put both of these ideas to use in demonstrating the JPEG compression algorithm.  An image is broken into \(8\times8\) blocks, and the colors into luminance, blue chrominance, and red chrominance.  Applying the Discrete Fourier Transform allowed us to reconstruct a good approximation of the image using only a small number of Fourier coefficients.</p></li>
