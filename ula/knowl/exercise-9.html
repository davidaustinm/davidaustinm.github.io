<p>The fuel inside model rocket motors is a black powder mixture that ideally consists of 60% charcoal, 30% potassium nitrate, and 10% sulfur by weight.</p>
<p>Suppose you work at a company that makes model rocket motors.  When you come into work one morning, you learn that yesterday's first shift made a perfect batch of fuel.  The second shift, however, misread the recipe and used 50% charcoal, 20% potassium nitrate and 30% sulfur.  Then the two batches were mixed together.  A chemical analysis shows that there are 100.3 pounds of charcoal in the mixture and 46.9 pounds of potassium nitrate.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assuming the first shift produced \(x\) pounds of fuel and the second \(y\) pounds, set up a linear system in terms of \(x\) and \(y\text{.}\)  How many pounds of fuel did the first shift produce and how many did the second shift produce? <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-17"><script type="text/x-sage">

<li><p>How much sulfur would you expect to find in the mixture?</p></li>
