<p>One can analyze the full version of Chutes and Ladders having 100 squares in the same way.  Without any chutes or ladders, one finds that the average number of moves required to reach square 100 is 29.0.  Once we add the chutes and ladders back in, the average number of moves required to reach square 100 is 27.1.  This shows that the average number of moves does not change significantly when we add the chutes and ladders.  There is, however, much more variation in the possibilities because it is possible to reach square 100 much more quickly and much more slowly.</p>
