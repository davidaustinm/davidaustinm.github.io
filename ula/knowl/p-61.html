<p>This activity considers sets of equations having three unknowns.  In this case, we know that the solutions of a single equation form a plane.  If it helps with visualization, consider using <span class="process-math">\(3\times5\)</span>-inch index cards to represent planes.</p>

<li><p>Is it possible that there are no solutions to two linear equations in three unknowns?  Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that there is exactly one solution to two linear equations in three unknowns?  Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that the solutions to four equations in three unknowns form a line?  Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.</p></li>
<li><p>What would you usually expect for the set of solutions to four equations in three unknowns?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose we have a set of 500 linear equations in 10 unknowns.  Which of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-possibilities.html" title="Assemblage: Solutions to sets of linear equations">three possibilities</a> would you expect to hold?</p></li>
