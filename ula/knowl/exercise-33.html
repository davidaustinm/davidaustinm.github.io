<p>The operations that we perform in Gaussian elimination can be accomplished using matrix multiplication.  This observation is the basis of an important technique that we will investigate in a subsequent chapter.</p>
<p>Let's consider the matrix</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 2 \amp -1 \\
2 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
-3 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 7 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Verify that \(SA\) is the matrix that results when the second row of \(A\) is scaled by a factor of 7.  What matrix \(S\) would scale the third row by -3?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Verify that \(PA\) is the matrix that results from interchanging the first and second rows.  What matrix \(P\) would interchange the first and third rows?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
L_1 = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
-2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Verify that \(L_1A\) is the matrix that results from multiplying the first row of \(A\) by \(-2\) and adding it to the second row.  What matrix \(L_2\) would multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the third row?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we performed Gaussian elimination, our first goal was to perform row operations that brought the matrix into a triangular form.  For our matrix \(A\text{,}\) find the row operations needed to find a row equivalent matrix \(U\) in triangular form.  By expressing these row operations in terms of matrix multiplication, find a matrix \(L\) such that \(LA = U\text{.}\) <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-48"><script type="text/x-sage">
