<p>We have now introduced \(LU\) factorizations as a technique for solving equations \(A\xvec = \bvec\text{,}\) but we have yet to explain why they are useful.  It becomes apparent when we consider the type of equations that we are solving;  for instance, \(L\cvec = \bvec\) in our example has the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
-2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
3 \amp 1 \amp 1
\end{array}\right]\cvec = \threevec4{-7}{12}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Because \(L\) is a lower-triangular matrix, it contains lots of zeros.  In fact, we are able to read off the first component of \(\cvec\) directly from the equations:  \(c_1 = 4\text{.}\)  We then have \(-2c_1+c_2 = -7\text{,}\) which gives \(c_2 = 1\text{,}\) and \(3c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 12\text{,}\) which gives \(c_3=-1\text{.}\)  As this shows, solving equations involving triangular matrices is quite easy because we essentially only need to perform a sequence of substitutions.</p>
