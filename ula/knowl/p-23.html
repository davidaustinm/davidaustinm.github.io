<p>At its heart, the subject of linear algebra is about linear equations and, more specifically, collections of linear equations.  Google routinely deals with a collection of trillions of equations each of which has trillions of unknowns. We will eventually understand how to deal with that kind of complexity.  To begin, however, we will look at a more familiar situation where we have a small number of equations and a small number of unknowns.  In spite of its relative simplicity, this situation is rich enough to demonstrate some fundamental concepts that we will motivate much of our exploration.</p>
