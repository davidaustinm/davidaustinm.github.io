<p>One could find the same result by applying a different sequence of replacement and scaling operations.  However, we chose this particular sequence guided by our desire to first transform the system into a triangular one.  To do this, we eliminated the first unknown \(x\) from all but one equation and then proceeded to the next unknowns working left to right.  Once we had a triangular system, we used back substitution moving through the unknowns right to left.</p>
