<p>Suppose we have two species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that interact with each another and that we record the change in their populations from year to year.  When we begin our study, the populations, measured in thousands, are <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_0\text{;}\)</span> after <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> years, the populations are <span class="process-math">\(R_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_k\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>If we know the populations in one year, suppose that the populations in the following year are determined by the expressions</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
R_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.9 R_k + 0.8 S_k \\
S_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.2 R_k + 0.9 S_k\text{.} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This is an example of a mutually beneficial relationship between two species.  If species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not present, then <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1} = 0.9R_k\text{,}\)</span> which means that the population of species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> decreases every year.  However, species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> benefits from the presence of species <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> which helps <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to grow by 80% of the population of species <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>  In the same way, <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> benefits from the presence of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We will record the populations in a vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_k = \twovec{R_k}{S_k}\)</span> and note that <span class="process-math">\(\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
