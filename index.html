	  PreFigure for accessible mathematical diagrams
	</h3>

	<p>
	  <a href="https://prefigure.org"
	  target="_blank">PreFigure</a> is an authoring system for
	  creating accessible 
	  mathematical diagrams for including in scholarly documents.
	  From a single diagram description written by an author,
	  PreFigure can create an SVG suitable for posting on a web
	  page, with included annotations enabling a screen reader to
	  effectively navigate the diagram, a PDF for including in a
	  printed document, and a tactile diagram to be embossed and
	  included with a braille document.
        </p>

        <p>
	  PreFigure is very much inspired by
	  <a href="https://pretextbook.org/"
	  target="_blank">PreTeXt</a> and is tightly integrated
	  with PreTeXt.  For example, it is possible to write
	  PreFigure diagram descriptions inside a PreTeXt document and
	  have the resulting diagrams included in the 
	  PreTeXt output.
	</p>
